Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import ast
    ...
    def test_AST_objects(self):
        x = ast.AST()
        self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
        x.foobar = 42
        self.assertEqual(x.foobar, "42")
        self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)

        with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
            x.vararg

        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
            ast.AST(2)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

Let's evaluate the provided test case step by step:

1. Import the `ast` module:
```python
import ast
```
This step should execute without issues.

2. Create an instance of the base AST object:
```python
x = ast.AST()
```
This step should also execute without any issues, as `ast.AST` is the base class for all AST nodes.

3. Assert the `_fields` attribute of the `AST` object:
```python
self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
```
The `ast.AST` class has an `_fields` attribute which is an empty tuple, so this assertion should pass.

4. Set a new attribute `foobar` to the AST object and check its value:
```python
x.foobar = 42
self.assertEqual(x.foobar, "42")
```
This assertion will fail. While you can indeed add a new attribute `foobar` to the `AST` object and assign it a value of `42`, the value is an integer and not a string. Therefore, the assertion `self.assertEqual(x.foobar, "42")` will fail because `42` (an integer) is not equal to `"42"` (a string).

5. Check the `__dict__` of the object to see if `foobar` exists:
```python
self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)
```
This assertion will pass. When you added the `foobar` attribute to the `AST` object, it gets stored in its `__dict__` attribute.

6. Test for non-existent attributes:
```python
with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
    x.vararg
```
This assertion will pass because the `AST` object `x` does not have a `vararg` attribute, and trying to access it will raise an `AttributeError`.

7. Test the constructor with arguments:
```python
with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
    # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
    ast.AST(2)
```
This assertion will pass. The `ast.AST` constructor does not take any positional arguments, so passing `2` to it will raise a `TypeError`.

Conclusion:
The test will fail due to the following assertion:
```python
self.assertEqual(x.foobar, "42")
```
Because `x.foobar` is `42` (integer) and not `"42"` (string).
