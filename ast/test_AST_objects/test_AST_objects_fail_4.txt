Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import ast
    ...
    def test_AST_objects(self):
        x = ast.AST()
        self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
        x.foobar = 42
        self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)
        self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)

        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            x.vararg

        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
            ast.AST(2)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The code snippet given tests some behaviors of the `ast.AST` class in the Python Standard Library. Let's analyze the test step by step:

1. Create an `AST` object `x` and check that its `_fields` attribute is an empty tuple.
   ```python
   x = ast.AST()
   self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
   ```
   This should pass, as the default `ast.AST` object does not have any fields.

2. Add an arbitrary attribute `foobar` to `x` and check its value:
   ```python
   x.foobar = 42
   self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)
   ```
   This will pass. You can add new attributes to instances of most Python classes, including instances of `ast.AST`.

3. Check that the `foobar` attribute is stored in the `__dict__` of `x`:
   ```python
   self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)
   ```
   This should pass, as instance attributes are generally stored in the `__dict__` of an object.

4. Ensure a `TypeError` is raised when trying to access a non-existent attribute of `x`:
   ```python
   with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
       x.vararg
   ```
   This will pass. Unlike regular Python objects, if you try to access an attribute of an `ast.AST` object that doesn't exist, it will raise a `TypeError` rather than an `AttributeError`.

5. Check that instantiating the `AST` class with positional arguments raises a `TypeError`:
   ```python
   with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
       ast.AST(2)
   ```
   This should pass, as the default constructor for `ast.AST` does not accept any positional arguments.

Considering the above analysis, the test should pass without any failures.
