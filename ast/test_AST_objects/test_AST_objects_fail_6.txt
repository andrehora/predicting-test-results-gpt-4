Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import ast
    ...
    def test_AST_objects(self):
        x = ast.AST()
        self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
        x.foobar = 42
        self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)
        self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)

        x.vararg

        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
            ast.AST(2)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

Let's break down the test step by step:

1. We are importing the `ast` module which provides classes to work with abstract syntax trees.
2. An instance `x` of the `ast.AST` class is created. This is an empty abstract syntax tree node.

```python
x = ast.AST()
```

3. The next assertion checks if the `_fields` attribute of `x` is an empty tuple. This attribute is used to enumerate all fields in an AST node, and since this is a base class node, there should be no fields.
 
```python
self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
```

4. We then set an arbitrary attribute `foobar` with a value of `42` to the instance `x`. This is allowed because Python objects generally allow you to add attributes on the fly.

```python
x.foobar = 42
```

5. The following two assertions check if the `foobar` attribute exists with the value `42` and if the dictionary representation of the instance `x` contains the key `foobar` with the value `42`. Both assertions should pass.

```python
self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)
self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)
```

6. The line `x.vararg` will throw an `AttributeError` since the `vararg` attribute does not exist in the `ast.AST` instance. This will cause the test to fail unless it is wrapped inside an assertion that expects an `AttributeError`. 

```python
x.vararg
```

7. Lastly, the test checks if the `ast.AST` constructor raises a `TypeError` when passed a positional argument. This assertion should pass since the base `ast.AST` class constructor doesn't take any positional arguments.

```python
with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
    ast.AST(2)
```

**Conclusion**:
The test will fail due to the line `x.vararg` raising an `AttributeError`. If you remove or properly handle this line, the rest of the test should pass.
