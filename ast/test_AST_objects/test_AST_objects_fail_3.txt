Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import ast
    ...
    def test_AST_objects(self):
        x = ast.AST()
        self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
        x.foobar = 42
        self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)
        self.assertNotEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)

        with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
            x.vararg

        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
            ast.AST(2)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test step by step:

1. The `ast` module is imported successfully, as it is a part of the Python Standard Library.

2. The test function `test_AST_objects` is defined.

3. Within the function:
    - An instance `x` of `ast.AST` is created.
    - The `_fields` attribute of `x` is checked, which should return an empty tuple for a base `ast.AST` instance. This should pass.
    - A custom attribute `foobar` is set on `x` to the value `42`. This is allowed, as Python objects allow dynamic attribute assignments.
    - The test checks if the value of `x.foobar` is indeed `42`. This should pass.
    - The test checks if `x.__dict__["foobar"]` is not equal to `42`. This is where a problem may arise. The `__dict__` attribute of an instance typically stores its attributes. If `x.foobar` is set to `42`, then it's expected that `x.__dict__["foobar"]` would also be `42`, contradicting the test assertion. Therefore, this test should fail.
    - The test checks for an `AttributeError` when trying to access an undefined attribute `vararg` of `x`. This should pass, as `x` doesn't have an attribute named `vararg`.
    - The test checks for a `TypeError` when trying to pass an argument to the `ast.AST` constructor. This should pass since the `ast.AST` constructor does not accept any positional arguments.

Based on the above analysis, the test should fail at the assertion `self.assertNotEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)`, because it's expected that `x.__dict__["foobar"]` would indeed be `42`.
