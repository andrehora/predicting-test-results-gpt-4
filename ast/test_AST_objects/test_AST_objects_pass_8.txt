Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import ast
    ...
    def test_AST_objects(self):
        x = ast.AST()
        self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
        x.foobar = 42
        self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)
        self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)

        with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
            x.vararg

        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            # "ast.AST constructor takes 2 positional arguments"
            ast.AST(2, 2)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test step by step:

1. We're importing the `ast` module.
2. We're creating an instance of the `AST` class.
3. We're checking if the `_fields` attribute of the instance is an empty tuple. `_fields` is a class attribute of `AST` that defines the fields for that node type.
4. We're adding a new attribute `foobar` to the `x` instance and setting its value to `42`.
5. We're checking if the `foobar` attribute of the instance is `42`.
6. We're checking if the `__dict__` attribute of the instance contains the key `foobar` with the value `42`.
7. We're checking if accessing an undefined attribute `vararg` raises an `AttributeError`.
8. We're checking if trying to create an `AST` instance with two positional arguments raises a `TypeError`.

Now, let's analyze each step:

1. Importing the `ast` module is standard and should not cause an error.
2. The instantiation of the `AST` class should be successful as it takes no required arguments.
3. The `AST` class, being the base class for all AST node types, has no fields, so `_fields` should indeed be an empty tuple.
4. Assigning an arbitrary attribute to an instance is valid in Python.
5. Since we've just assigned the `foobar` attribute to `42`, this check should pass.
6. In Python, the `__dict__` attribute of an object holds its attributes. Thus, since we've added `foobar` to `x`, this check should also pass.
7. Accessing an undefined attribute of an object in Python raises an `AttributeError`. Hence, this check should pass.
8. This is the trickiest part. The error message mentioned in the comment suggests that `ast.AST` is expected to throw a `TypeError` with a specific error message when given two positional arguments. However, the base `AST` class, as of Python 3.10, does not enforce such a constraint, and there are no required arguments for its instantiation. This check will raise a different error than what's expected, or it might not raise an error at all.

Based on the above analysis, the test will fail on the last check, i.e., the attempt to create an instance of `AST` with two positional arguments. The provided error message in the comment is misleading, and the `AST` constructor does not have such a constraint in Python 3.10.
