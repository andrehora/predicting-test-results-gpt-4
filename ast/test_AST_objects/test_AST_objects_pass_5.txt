Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import ast
    ...
    def test_AST_objects(self):
        x = ast.AST()
        self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
        x.foobar = 42
        self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)
        self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)

        with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
            x.vararg

        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
            ast.AST(-1)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test:

1. Import the `ast` module.
2. Define a function `test_AST_objects`.
3. Within the function, an instance `x` of `ast.AST` is created. 
4. Assert that the `_fields` attribute of the instance is an empty tuple.
5. Set a new attribute `foobar` on `x` with a value of 42.
6. Assert that the attribute `foobar` has a value of 42.
7. Assert that `foobar` is present in the `__dict__` of `x` and has a value of 42.
8. Check that accessing a non-existing attribute `vararg` raises an `AttributeError`.
9. Check that trying to initialize an `ast.AST` object with a positional argument raises a `TypeError` with the specific message.

The main point of this test is to ensure that the `ast.AST` class behaves as expected in terms of attribute assignment, attribute access, and instantiation. Let's review the key steps:

- `ast.AST()` should initialize successfully without any arguments.
- `_fields` is a tuple containing the names of all fields that are defined in a particular AST node type, and it should be empty for a base `ast.AST` instance.
- Dynamically assigning attributes to an instance of `ast.AST` (like `foobar`) should work.
- Accessing a non-existing attribute should raise an `AttributeError`.
- Initializing an `ast.AST` object with positional arguments should raise a `TypeError`.

As of Python 3.10, the behavior described in this test is consistent with the `ast.AST` class behavior. Specifically, the `ast.AST` class is designed to support dynamic attribute assignment (hence the assignment of `foobar` works), and its constructor doesn't take positional arguments (hence the `TypeError` assertion).

Therefore, the provided test should pass for Python Standard Library, version 3.10.
