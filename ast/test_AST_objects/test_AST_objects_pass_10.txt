Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import ast
    ...
    def test_AST_objects(self):
        x = ast.AST()
        r = 42
        self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
        x.foobar = r
        self.assertEqual(x.foobar, r)
        self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], r)

        with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
            x.vararg

        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
            ast.AST(2)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

Let's break down the test and evaluate each segment:

1. Creating an instance of the base AST class:
```python
x = ast.AST()
```
This will succeed, as the base `ast.AST` class can be instantiated without any arguments.

2. Checking that the `_fields` attribute of the base AST class is an empty tuple:
```python
self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
```
This will succeed. The `_fields` attribute of the base `ast.AST` class is an empty tuple.

3. Assigning a new attribute `foobar` to the `x` object and validating its value:
```python
x.foobar = r
self.assertEqual(x.foobar, r)
```
This will succeed because you can assign arbitrary attributes to Python objects unless they explicitly prevent this behavior. Here, `x.foobar` is assigned the value of `r` (42), so checking `x.foobar` against `r` will return `True`.

4. Verifying the attribute through the object's `__dict__`:
```python
self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], r)
```
This will also succeed. When you assign an attribute to a Python object (that doesn't have a custom descriptor for that attribute), it gets stored in the object's `__dict__`.

5. Trying to access a non-existent attribute `vararg`:
```python
with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
    x.vararg
```
This will succeed. `x` doesn't have an attribute named `vararg`, so an `AttributeError` will be raised.

6. Trying to create an instance of the `ast.AST` class with a positional argument:
```python
with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
    ast.AST(2)
```
This will also succeed. The `ast.AST` constructor doesn't take any positional arguments, so a `TypeError` will be raised.

Given the above explanations, the test will pass without any failures.
