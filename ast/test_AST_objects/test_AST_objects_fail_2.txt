Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import ast
    ...
    def test_AST_objects(self):
        x = ast.AST()
        self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
        x.foobar = 42
        self.assertNotEqual(x.foobar, 42)
        self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)

        with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
            x.vararg

        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
            ast.AST(2)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

Let's break down the test case by case:

1. Creation of an AST object and checking its fields:
```python
x = ast.AST()
self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
```
This should work as intended. The `ast.AST` class is the base class for all AST nodes, and its `_fields` attribute is an empty tuple.

2. Adding a new attribute `foobar` and checking its value:
```python
x.foobar = 42
self.assertNotEqual(x.foobar, 42)
```
This will fail. Once you set the attribute `foobar` to the value `42`, it will hold the value `42`. So, the assertion `self.assertNotEqual(x.foobar, 42)` is incorrect. It should be `self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)`.

3. Accessing the `foobar` attribute from the `__dict__`:
```python
self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)
```
This should pass as the attribute `foobar` was set to the value `42` in the previous step.

4. Checking for a non-existent attribute `vararg`:
```python
with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
    x.vararg
```
This should pass since the attribute `vararg` was never set for the object `x`.

5. Trying to create an `ast.AST` object with a positional argument:
```python
with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
    # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
    ast.AST(2)
```
This should pass. The `ast.AST` constructor doesn't accept positional arguments.

In summary, the test will fail due to the second case where the test incorrectly checks that the newly set attribute `foobar` is not equal to `42`. The correct assertion should be `self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)`.
