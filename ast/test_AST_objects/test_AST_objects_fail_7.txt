Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import ast
    ...
    def test_AST_objects(self):
        x = ast.AST()
        self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
        x.foobar = 42
        self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)
        self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)

        with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
            x.vararg

        # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
        ast.AST(2)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

Let's go through this test piece by piece:

1. Import the `ast` module.
```python
import ast
```
This is straightforward and should work.

2. Create an instance of `ast.AST`:
```python
x = ast.AST()
```
This is valid. An instance of the `ast.AST` class can be created without any arguments.

3. Check that the `_fields` attribute of the `ast.AST` instance is an empty tuple:
```python
self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
```
This is also valid. The base `ast.AST` class doesn't have any fields defined, so `_fields` will be an empty tuple.

4. Assign an attribute `foobar` to the instance and check its value:
```python
x.foobar = 42
self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)
```
This is valid. You can assign arbitrary attributes to Python objects.

5. Check that the attribute `foobar` is stored in the instance's `__dict__`:
```python
self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)
```
This is valid. Attributes of an instance are stored in its `__dict__`.

6. Make sure that accessing a non-existent attribute raises an `AttributeError`:
```python
with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
    x.vararg
```
This is also valid. Accessing an attribute that hasn't been set will raise an `AttributeError`.

7. Try to create an instance of `ast.AST` with a positional argument:
```python
ast.AST(2)
```
This is expected to raise a `TypeError` because the `ast.AST` constructor does not take any positional arguments. The comment suggests the error message is "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments". However, the test doesn't actually assert this exception; this will lead to a test failure.

In conclusion, the test will fail at the last line because there's no assertion to expect a `TypeError` when trying to create an instance of `ast.AST` with a positional argument. The rest of the test cases are correct. To fix it, the last section of the test should be wrapped with `self.assertRaises(TypeError)` like this:

```python
with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
    ast.AST(2)
```
