Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import ast
    ...
    def test_AST_objects(self):
        x = ast.AST()
        self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
        x.foobar = 42
        self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)
        self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)

        with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
            x.vararg

        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
            ast.AST(-1, -1)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test:

1. An `AST` object `x` is created.
2. The `_fields` attribute of the `AST` object is checked to be an empty tuple.
3. A new attribute `foobar` is assigned to the `AST` object with the value `42`.
4. The value of the `foobar` attribute is checked.
5. The presence of the `foobar` attribute in the object's `__dict__` is checked.
6. An attempt to access a non-existent attribute `vararg` is made and expected to raise `AttributeError`.
7. An attempt to create an `AST` object with arguments is made and expected to raise `TypeError`.

Based on my knowledge of the `ast.AST` class:

1. Creating an `AST` object should not be problematic.
2. The `_fields` attribute of a base `AST` object is an empty tuple.
3. Custom attributes can be added to Python objects, so assigning `foobar` with value `42` should work.
4. Accessing `x.foobar` after assignment should return `42`.
5. Since `foobar` is a dynamic attribute added to the object, it should be in its `__dict__`.
6. Accessing an attribute that doesn't exist will raise an `AttributeError`.
7. The base `ast.AST` class does not accept positional arguments in its constructor, so it should raise a `TypeError`.

Based on this analysis, the test should pass without any errors.
