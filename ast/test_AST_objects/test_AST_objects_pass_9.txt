Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import ast
    ...
    def test_AST_objects(self):
        x = ast.AST()
        self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
        x.foobar = 42
        x.foobar2 = 43
        self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)
        self.assertEqual(x.foobar2, 43)
        self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)
        self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar2"], 43)

        with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
            x.vararg

        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
            ast.AST(2)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test step-by-step:

1. Creating an instance of the base `AST` class:
   ```python
   x = ast.AST()
   ```

2. Checking that the `_fields` attribute of the `AST` class instance is an empty tuple:
   ```python
   self.assertEqual(x._fields, ())
   ```

3. Assigning some custom attributes to the `AST` class instance:
   ```python
   x.foobar = 42
   x.foobar2 = 43
   ```

4. Checking the value of these custom attributes:
   ```python
   self.assertEqual(x.foobar, 42)
   self.assertEqual(x.foobar2, 43)
   ```

5. Checking the presence of these custom attributes in the instance's dictionary:
   ```python
   self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar"], 42)
   self.assertEqual(x.__dict__["foobar2"], 43)
   ```

6. Ensuring that accessing a non-existent attribute on the instance raises an `AttributeError`:
   ```python
   with self.assertRaises(AttributeError):
       x.vararg
   ```

7. Ensuring that trying to pass arguments to the `AST` class constructor raises a `TypeError`:
   ```python
   with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
       # "ast.AST constructor takes 0 positional arguments"
       ast.AST(2)
   ```

Given my understanding of Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) module and how the base `AST` class behaves, here's what I think:

1. Creating an instance of the base `AST` class should not raise any issues.
   
2. The `_fields` attribute for the base `AST` class should be an empty tuple. This means this check is likely to pass.
   
3. Custom attributes can be assigned to instances of Python classes, so the assignments should work without issues.
   
4. Since the attributes were assigned in step 3, the checks in step 4 should pass.
   
5. Since the attributes were assigned in step 3, they should be available in the instance's dictionary, and the checks in step 5 should pass.
   
6. Accessing a non-existent attribute on an instance should raise an `AttributeError`. This check should pass.
   
7. The `AST` class's constructor does not expect any positional arguments. So, trying to pass one should raise a `TypeError`. This check should pass.

Therefore, given the above analysis, the test should pass without any failures.
