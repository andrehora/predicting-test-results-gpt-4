Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_bad_params(self):
        # Test invalid parameter combinations.
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            gzip.open(123.456)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "wt", encoding="utf-8")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", errors="ignore")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", newline="\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test appears to be checking for various invalid parameter combinations when trying to open a gzip file using `gzip.open()`. 

Let's break down each test case:

1. `gzip.open(123.456)`
   
   This checks if `gzip.open()` raises a `TypeError` when passed a float as the filename. This is clearly an invalid input, so this should raise the expected exception.

2. `gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")`

   This tests if `gzip.open()` raises a `ValueError` when given the mode "wbt". In the standard open method in Python, the mode can be text ("t") or binary ("b"), but not both. Hence, "wbt" is invalid, and should raise the expected exception.

3. `gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")`

   Similarly, this tests for the mode "xbt", which again combines text and binary modes, so this should also raise a `ValueError`.

4. `gzip.open(self.filename, "wt", encoding="utf-8")`

   This tests if `gzip.open()` raises a `ValueError` when given the mode "wt" along with an encoding. The "wt" mode implies text mode, but in the context of `gzip.open()`, text modes are not supported. Therefore, this should raise the expected exception.

5. `gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", errors="ignore")`

   This checks if a `ValueError` is raised when the "rb" (read binary) mode is used alongside the `errors` parameter, which is only applicable to text modes. So, this should raise the expected exception.

6. `gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", newline="\n")`

   This checks if a `ValueError` is raised when the "rb" (read binary) mode is used alongside the `newline` parameter, which again is only applicable to text modes. This should also raise the expected exception.

Given that each individual test checks for a scenario where `gzip.open()` should throw an exception due to invalid parameters and the tests seem correctly set up, this test is expected to pass. If the test fails, it would imply a change or bug in the behavior of `gzip.open()` as of Python 3.10.
