Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_bad_params(self):
        # Test invalid parameter combinations.
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            gzip.open(123.456)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", encoding="utf-8")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", errors="ignore")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", newline="\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's go through the test cases step by step:

1. 
```python
gzip.open(123.456)
```
This is expected to raise a `TypeError` because the first argument to `gzip.open()` is supposed to be a filename (string) or a file object. A floating point number is neither of those, so this test case should correctly raise the expected exception.

2. 
```python
gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")
```
This tests if the mode string "wbt" is valid. The gzip mode strings typically consist of one of 'r', 'w', 'x' or 'a' followed optionally by 'b' and 't'. In this case, "wbt" is not a valid combination. Therefore, this should raise a `ValueError` as expected.

3. 
```python
gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")
```
Similarly, "xbt" is not a valid mode string. "x" stands for exclusive creation, preventing overwriting an existing file, and can be followed by 'b' or 't', but not both. This test case should raise a `ValueError` as expected.

4. 
```python
gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", encoding="utf-8")
```
In this case, the file is being opened in binary mode ("rb"). However, an encoding parameter is also provided. The encoding parameter is applicable only for text mode. Hence, this combination should raise a `ValueError` as expected.

5. 
```python
gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", errors="ignore")
```
Similar to the previous test, providing an `errors` parameter in binary mode should be invalid. Thus, this should also raise a `ValueError` as expected.

6. 
```python
gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", newline="\n")
```
Again, since the file is being opened in binary mode, providing a `newline` parameter, which is applicable only for text mode, is invalid. This should raise a `ValueError` as expected.

Given the understanding of the `gzip.open` function and its expected behavior, all the test cases seem to be correctly checking for the expected exceptions. Therefore, this test should pass if the `gzip` module behavior remains consistent with the documentation and there aren't any external errors in the code (like errors in `self.filename` assignment, or missing pieces in the provided code snippet).
