Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_bad_params(self):
        # Test invalid parameter combinations.
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            gzip.open(123.456)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", encoding="utf-8")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", errors="ignore")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "wt", newline="\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's analyze the test case by case:

1. `gzip.open(123.456)`
   This test case is trying to open a file with a float instead of a string filename or a bytes-like object. This should raise a `TypeError`.

2. `gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")`
   For the mode, gzip accepts either text or binary modes but not both. The 't' stands for text mode, while the 'b' stands for binary mode. Hence, "wbt" is not a valid mode. This should raise a `ValueError`.

3. `gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")`
   This case is similar to the previous one. The "x" stands for exclusive creation, preventing the file from being overwritten if it already exists. But again, both "b" and "t" are used together, which is not allowed. This should raise a `ValueError`.

4. `gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", encoding="utf-8")`
   The file is being opened in binary mode ("rb"), but the encoding parameter is being specified. Encoding is only relevant for text mode. So, using an encoding with binary mode should raise a `ValueError`.

5. `gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", errors="ignore")`
   This is similar to the previous case. The errors parameter is related to how encoding and decoding errors should be handled, which is relevant only for text mode. Using it with binary mode should raise a `ValueError`.

6. `gzip.open(self.filename, "wt", newline="\n")`
   This case is opening the file in text mode ("wt") and specifies a newline parameter. As of Python 3.10, the newline parameter is supported in the `open()` function. However, the `gzip.open()` documentation does not list `newline` as a valid parameter. Thus, this should raise a `ValueError`.

Considering the above analysis, each of the test cases should raise the exception it expects. Therefore, this test should pass.

However, one caveat is that the test's correctness is based on Python Standard Library version 3.10 as mentioned by the user. If there are changes in future versions, the behavior might differ.
