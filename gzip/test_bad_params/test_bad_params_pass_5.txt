Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_bad_params(self):
        # Test invalid parameter combinations.
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            gzip.open(123.456)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", errors="ignore")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", newline="\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

To determine if the test will pass or fail, let's examine each case individually:

1. `gzip.open(123.456)`
   
   This test checks if `gzip.open` will raise a `TypeError` if a float value is passed as the filename. Since the first parameter of `gzip.open` should be a string representing the file name, this should indeed raise a `TypeError`. 

2. `gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")` and `gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")`

   Here, the test is checking for invalid mode combinations. The modes "wbt" and "xbt" are not valid mode strings for `gzip.open`. In Python, for the built-in `open` function, "b" stands for binary mode and "t" stands for text mode. You can't use both together since they are mutually exclusive. The same logic is applied for `gzip.open`, so these should raise `ValueError`.

3. `gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore")`

   This test checks if a `ValueError` is raised when opening a file in binary mode (`"rb"`) and also specifying encoding and error parameters. These parameters are meant for text mode. Since the file is being opened in binary mode, these parameters are invalid, and this should indeed raise a `ValueError`.

4. `gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", errors="ignore")`

   Similar to the previous test, it checks for a `ValueError` when opening in binary mode but providing an `errors` parameter which is meant for text mode. This should raise a `ValueError`.

5. `gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", newline="\n")`

   The `newline` parameter is used to control how universal newlines mode works (it controls the line ending conversion). This test is checking if a `ValueError` is raised when opening a file in binary mode and also specifying a `newline` parameter. Again, since the file is being opened in binary mode, the `newline` parameter shouldn't be applicable and should raise a `ValueError`.

Given the descriptions and the expected behavior of the `gzip.open` method based on the Python 3.10 documentation and my knowledge up to the date of the last training data, the test should pass.

However, to be 100% sure, the actual behavior would need to be tested in a real Python 3.10 environment.
