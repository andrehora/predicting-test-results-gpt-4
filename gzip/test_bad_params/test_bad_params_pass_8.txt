Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_bad_params(self):
        # Test invalid parameter combinations.
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            gzip.open(123.456)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", encoding="utf-8")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "wb", errors="ignore")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", newline="\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

To determine whether this test will pass or fail, let's go over each of the assertions:

1. `gzip.open(123.456)`: This test is attempting to open a gzip file using a float as its name, which is clearly not a valid filename. The expected exception is `TypeError`.

2. `gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")`: The "wbt" mode is not a valid mode for opening a gzip file. The "t" indicates text mode, and it's invalid to specify both binary ('b') and text ('t') modes simultaneously. The expected exception is `ValueError`.

3. `gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")`: The "xbt" mode has the same issue as "wbt". Both binary and text modes are specified, which is invalid. The expected exception is `ValueError`.

4. `gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", encoding="utf-8")`: This assertion is attempting to open a gzip file in binary mode ("rb") with an encoding specified. Encoding is used for text mode, so specifying encoding in binary mode should raise a `ValueError`.

5. `gzip.open(self.filename, "wb", errors="ignore")`: This is similar to the above case. The test is attempting to open a gzip file in binary mode ("wb") with the errors argument specified. The `errors` parameter is used to define how encoding/decoding errors are handled in text mode, and it should not be valid with binary mode. The expected exception is `ValueError`.

6. `gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", newline="\n")`: This assertion is trying to open a gzip file in binary mode ("rb") with a newline character specified. The `newline` argument is used for text mode to determine how newline characters are handled. Specifying it in binary mode should raise a `ValueError`.

Given the nature of the assertions and the expected exceptions, this test should pass if the `gzip.open` method behaves as described in the Python documentation and rejects the invalid combinations.

However, to be absolutely sure, one would need to run the test against the Python 3.10 Standard Library. If there have been no changes to the behavior of the `gzip.open` method since the documentation, then the test should pass.
