Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_bad_params(self):
        # Test invalid parameter combinations.
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            gzip.open(123.456)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", encoding="utf-8")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", errors="ignore")
        gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", newline="\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test to analyze whether it'll pass or fail based on the Python Standard Library version 3.10.

1. `gzip.open(123.456)`
   This attempts to open a gzip-compressed file with a float as its name. This is invalid since the file name should be a string (or bytes). It is expected to raise a `TypeError`.

2. `gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")`
   The mode `wbt` contains both 'b' (binary) and 't' (text). These modes are mutually exclusive when opening files. Therefore, it should raise a `ValueError`.

3. `gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")`
   Similar to the above, the mode `xbt` contains both 'b' and 't'. This is also invalid and should raise a `ValueError`.

4. `gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", encoding="utf-8")`
   Here, the file is opened in binary mode (`rb`). Specifying an encoding is invalid when opening in binary mode since encoding is a concept for text mode. It should raise a `ValueError`.

5. `gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", errors="ignore")`
   Similar to the above, specifying error handling (e.g., 'ignore') is a concept for text mode. Since the file is being opened in binary mode, it should raise a `ValueError`.

6. `gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", newline="\n")`
   This line attempts to open a file in binary mode with a newline character set to `\n`. In the context of the gzip module in Python 3.10, this line is valid. It will not raise any exception.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that all the `assertRaises` conditions are valid and will raise the respective exceptions. The final `gzip.open` line is also valid and will not raise any exception.

**Conclusion**: The test should pass.
