Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_bad_params(self):
        # Test invalid parameter combinations.
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            gzip.open(123.456)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", encoding="utf-8")
        gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", errors="ignore")
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", newline="\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

Let's go step-by-step through the test to see if it will pass or fail:

1. **gzip.open(123.456)**
   - Here, it's trying to open a gzip file with a float as the filename. This should raise a `TypeError` since the filename should be a string or bytes, so this part of the test should pass.

2. **gzip.open(self.filename, "wbt")**
   - In this case, it's trying to open a gzip file with the mode "wbt". The "b" denotes binary mode and "w" denotes write mode. However, the "t" here is redundant since "b" implies binary and "t" implies text mode. This should raise a `ValueError` because you can't combine both text and binary modes, so this part should pass.

3. **gzip.open(self.filename, "xbt")**
   - Similar to the previous case, the mode "xbt" is also mixing binary ("b") and text ("t") modes. "x" denotes exclusive creation mode, meaning it'll raise an error if the file already exists. Again, this should raise a `ValueError` due to the mixed modes. This part should pass as well.

4. **gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", encoding="utf-8")**
   - Here, it's trying to open a gzip file in binary read mode ("rb") but is also specifying an encoding. Since the file is opened in binary mode, the encoding parameter should not be allowed, and this should raise a `ValueError`. Thus, this part should pass.

5. **gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", errors="ignore")**
   - This line is trying to open a gzip file in binary read mode with the `errors` parameter set to "ignore". The `errors` parameter specifies how encoding and decoding errors should be handled, but since this is binary mode and no encoding/decoding is done, this line should not raise any error. The test doesn't expect any exception here, so this part should also pass.

6. **gzip.open(self.filename, "rb", newline="\n")**
   - Here, it's opening a gzip file in binary read mode while setting the `newline` parameter. The `newline` parameter controls how universal newlines mode works (it's used for reading files in text mode), so it shouldn't be applicable when reading in binary mode. Therefore, this should raise a `ValueError`, making this part pass as well.

Considering the above evaluations, the test should pass.
