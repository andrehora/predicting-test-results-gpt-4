Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_fileobj_mode(self):
        gzip.GzipFile(self.filename, "wb").close()
        with open(self.filename, "r+b") as f:
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='r') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='w') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='a') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='x') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
                gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='z')
        for mode in "rb", "r+b":
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f) as g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
        for mode in "wb", "ab", "xb":
            if "x" in mode:
                os_helper.unlink(self.filename)
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with self.assertWarns(FutureWarning):
                    g = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f)
                with g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's go through the test step by step and analyze it:

1. A Gzip file with the name `self.filename` is created and immediately closed.

2. A context block opens the gzipped file in `"r+b"` mode (meaning it can be both read and written to) as `f`.

    - Inside this block, various `gzip.GzipFile` objects are created with different `mode` values and the same `fileobj=f`. 
    - For each of these gzip objects, it's checked if the `mode` is `gzip.WRITE`. However, only `mode='w'`, `mode='a'`, and `mode='x'` should lead to `gzip.WRITE`. The mode `'r'` is for reading, so the assertion for `mode='r'` would fail. This is the first discrepancy.

3. A loop checks that, when the base file is opened in either `"rb"` (read binary) or `"r+b"` mode, and a `gzip.GzipFile` is created with that file object without explicitly specifying the mode, it defaults to `gzip.READ`. This seems correct based on the gzip documentation.

4. Another loop checks that, when the base file is opened in `"wb"`, `"ab"`, or `"xb"` mode, and a `gzip.GzipFile` is created with that file object without specifying the mode, a `FutureWarning` is raised. After this, it checks if the `mode` is `gzip.WRITE`. This is consistent with gzip's behavior because not specifying the mode defaults to `'rb'`, but if the underlying file is writeable, a warning is given, and the gzip object operates in write mode.

5. There's a small utility step to remove the file if its mode contains `"x"`, so the file can be recreated in the next loop iteration.

Given the above analysis, the test will fail because of the assertion within this section:

```python
with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='r') as g:
    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
```

Here, a gzip file is opened with `mode='r'` but the test wrongly asserts its mode to be `gzip.WRITE`. The correct mode for this gzip file should be `gzip.READ`.

In conclusion, the rationale for the test failure is that it wrongly expects a gzip file opened in 'read' mode to have a mode of `gzip.WRITE`.
