Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_fileobj_mode(self):
        gzip.GzipFile(self.filename, "wb").close()
        with open(self.filename, "r+b") as f:
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='r') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='w') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='a') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='x') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
                gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='z')
        for mode in "rb", "r+b":
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f) as g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
        for mode in "wb", "xb":
            if "x" in mode:
                os_helper.unlink(self.filename)
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with self.assertWarns(FutureWarning):
                    g = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f)
                with g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test and see what it's trying to validate:

1. **Create a gzip file and test `fileobj` modes with explicit modes provided:**
    - `gzip.GzipFile(self.filename, "wb").close()`: A gzipped file is created.
    - It opens the file in `r+b` mode and tries to instantiate `gzip.GzipFile` objects using different modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, `x`) to see if the internal mode of the GzipFile object (`g.mode`) corresponds correctly to `gzip.READ` or `gzip.WRITE` as expected.
    - It raises a ValueError when an unrecognized mode is provided (`z`).

2. **Test `fileobj` modes with implicit modes:**
    - If the mode is `rb` or `r+b`, it expects the mode of the GzipFile object to be `gzip.READ`.
    - If the mode is `wb` or `xb`, it expects a FutureWarning, and after that, the mode of the GzipFile object to be `gzip.WRITE`.

Based on my understanding of the `gzip.GzipFile` in Python 3.10, here's the rationale for each segment:

1. The explicit modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, `x`) will set the mode of the GzipFile correctly to either `gzip.READ` or `gzip.WRITE`. The ValueError for mode `z` is expected because it's not a valid mode.

2. For the implicit modes, there are a couple of things to consider:
    - Opening the gzip file in `rb` or `r+b` mode and not providing any mode to `gzip.GzipFile` will default to `gzip.READ` which is correct.
    - For `wb` or `xb` modes, a FutureWarning is expected. In Python 3.10, opening a `GzipFile` with a writable binary mode file object, without specifying a mode, is deprecated and raises a warning. After the warning, it's expected that the mode is `gzip.WRITE`, which is correct.

From the code and the expected behavior of `gzip.GzipFile` in Python 3.10, it seems like the test should pass. However, the key points here are:
- Ensure that `gzip.READ` and `gzip.WRITE` constants are correctly defined.
- Ensure that the file (`self.filename`) can be accessed, created, and deleted without any permission or path-related issues.
- Ensure that the utility functions and modules like `os_helper.unlink` work as intended.

If there's a failure, it's likely related to one of these points rather than the logic of the test. But based on the provided test code and the expected behavior of `gzip.GzipFile`, the test seems like it should pass.
