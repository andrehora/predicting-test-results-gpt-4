Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_fileobj_mode(self):
        gzip.GzipFile(self.filename, "wb").close()
        with open(self.filename, "r+b") as f:
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='r') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='w') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='a') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='x') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
                gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='wbt')
        for mode in "rb", "r+b":
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f) as g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
        for mode in "wb", "ab", "xb":
            if "x" in mode:
                os_helper.unlink(self.filename)
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with self.assertWarns(FutureWarning):
                    g = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f)
                with g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test step by step:

1. A gzip file is created using the filename.
2. The file is opened in "r+b" mode (read and write in binary).
3. Four checks are done to verify the mode of the gzip file when instantiated with various mode arguments: 'r', 'w', 'a', and 'x'. All these checks should pass as they simply assert that the gzip file has the correct mode.
4. There's a check for an invalid mode 'wbt'. This should raise a `ValueError`.
5. Two modes "rb" and "r+b" are tested. In both cases, the gzip file should have a mode of `gzip.READ`.
6. For modes "wb", "ab", and "xb", a `FutureWarning` is expected. And after that, the gzip file should have a mode of `gzip.WRITE`.

Given the provided test, there are several points that could potentially fail:

1. The modes 'r', 'w', 'a', and 'x' are valid modes for `GzipFile`. If any of them is processed incorrectly or if the implementation of `GzipFile` changes such that its mode attribute does not reflect `gzip.READ` or `gzip.WRITE` as expected, then the test will fail. 
   
2. The mode 'wbt' should be invalid and raise a `ValueError`. If `GzipFile` starts to accept this mode without raising an error, the test will fail.

3. If `GzipFile` does not issue a `FutureWarning` when instantiated with a file object opened in "wb", "ab", or "xb" mode, then the test will fail.

Based on the Python 3.10 Standard Library's documentation and behavior of `GzipFile`, this test should pass. However, if there are any bugs or unexpected changes in the behavior of `GzipFile`, then the test will fail.

To determine conclusively whether this test will pass or fail, one would need to run it against the Python 3.10 Standard Library.
