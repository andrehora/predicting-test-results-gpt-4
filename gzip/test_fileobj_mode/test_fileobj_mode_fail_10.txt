Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_fileobj_mode(self):
        gzip.GzipFile(self.filename, "wb").close()
        with open(self.filename, "r+b") as f:
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='r') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='w') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='a') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='x') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
            with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
                gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='z')
        for mode in "rb", "r+b":
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f) as g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
        for mode in "wb", "ab", "xb":
            if "x" in mode:
                os_helper.unlink(self.filename)
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with self.assertWarns(FutureWarning):
                    g = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f)
                with g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

Let's break down the code snippet step by step to see if the test would pass or fail.

1. The test creates an empty gzipped file with the line:
   ```python
   gzip.GzipFile(self.filename, "wb").close()
   ```

2. The file is opened in "r+b" mode (both reading and writing in binary), and several `gzip.GzipFile` objects are created with different modes, and their `mode` attribute is tested:
   - `'r'`: The test expects the mode to be `gzip.READ`. This seems correct.
   - `'w'`: The test expects the mode to be `gzip.WRITE`. This seems correct.
   - `'a'`: The test expects the mode to be `gzip.WRITE`. This seems correct as 'a' is for appending, which is a type of writing.
   - `'x'`: The test expects the mode to be `gzip.READ`. This might be problematic. In regular file operations, the mode `'x'` is for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists. This mode is meant for writing, not reading. This part of the test seems incorrect.

3. There's an attempt to create a `gzip.GzipFile` with mode `'z'`, which is not a recognized mode. The test expects a `ValueError` here, which is correct.

4. For modes "rb" and "r+b", when creating a `gzip.GzipFile` without specifying a mode, it defaults to `'rb'`. The test expects the mode to be `gzip.READ`, which is correct.

5. For modes "wb", "ab", and "xb":
   - If the mode contains 'x', the file is deleted to ensure it doesn't exist (as 'x' requires a non-existent file).
   - A `gzip.GzipFile` is created without specifying a mode. This should raise a `FutureWarning`, which the test checks for.
   - After creating the gzip file, the test expects its mode to be `gzip.WRITE`. This seems correct, as all these modes ("wb", "ab", "xb") are for writing.

Given the above analysis, the test will likely fail at this section:
```python
with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='x') as g:
    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
```
This assertion seems to be incorrect. If the `gzip.GzipFile` constructor behaves similarly to the built-in file mode, then mode `'x'` should cause the gzip file to be in `gzip.WRITE` mode, not `gzip.READ` mode.
