Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_fileobj_mode(self):
        gzip.GzipFile(self.filename, "wb").close()
        with open(self.filename, "r+b") as f:
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='r') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='w') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='a') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='x') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
                gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='z')
        for mode in "rb", "r+b":
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f) as g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
        for mode in "wb", "ab", "xb":
            if "x" in mode:
                os_helper.unlink(self.filename)
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with self.assertWarns(FutureWarning):
                    g = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f)
                with g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's walk through the test and analyze each part step by step.

1. `gzip.GzipFile(self.filename, "wb").close()`
This line is creating a gzip file with write mode and then immediately closing it.

2. The nested `with` statements:
```python
with open(self.filename, "r+b") as f:
    ...
```
The outer `with` statement is opening the gzipped file in read+write binary mode.

Within the nested `with` statements, the test is checking if the `gzip.GzipFile` object recognizes and accepts various mode parameters correctly when a `fileobj` is provided. 

- The mode 'r' should make the `gzip.GzipFile` object in read mode.
- The mode 'w', 'a', and 'x' should make the `gzip.GzipFile` object in write mode.
- The mode 'z' is invalid, so it should raise a `TypeError`.

From the code, it seems this segment is testing the correct behavior.

3. The following loop:
```python
for mode in "rb", "r+b":
    with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
        with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f) as g:
            self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
```
This is testing that if the file is opened in binary read mode or binary read+write mode and then passed as a `fileobj` to `gzip.GzipFile` without a mode, it should default to read mode.

4. The final loop:
```python
for mode in "wb", "ab", "xb":
    if "x" in mode:
        os_helper.unlink(self.filename)
    with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
        with self.assertWarns(FutureWarning):
            g = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f)
        with g:
            self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
```
Here, it's testing that if the file is opened in binary write, append, or exclusive creation mode and then passed as a `fileobj` to `gzip.GzipFile` without a mode, it should default to write mode. However, this behavior seems to be changing in the future, as indicated by the `self.assertWarns(FutureWarning)` context manager. This means that in future versions, the behavior might be different or deprecated.

To determine whether this test will pass or fail, we need to rely on the behavior of the `gzip.GzipFile` class in Python 3.10.

As per my last training data which includes Python documentation up to version 3.10, the behavior described in the test seems to be in line with how `gzip.GzipFile` is expected to work. Thus, the test should pass.

However, to be absolutely sure, one would have to actually run the test against the Python 3.10 Standard Library. But based on the information provided, there's no clear indication of a failure.
