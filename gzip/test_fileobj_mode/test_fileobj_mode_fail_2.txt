Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_fileobj_mode(self):
        gzip.GzipFile(self.filename, "wb").close()
        with open(self.filename, "r+b") as f:
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='r') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='w') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='a') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='x') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
                gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='z')
        for mode in "rb", "r+b":
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f) as g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
        for mode in "wb", "ab", "xb":
            if "x" in mode:
                os_helper.unlink(self.filename)
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with self.assertWarns(FutureWarning):
                    g = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f)
                with g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test and its components:

1. The test starts by creating a Gzip file and then closes it.
2. The file is opened in the "r+b" mode (which means reading and writing in binary mode). This ensures that we can both read from and write to the file.
3. The mode of the gzip file is tested against expected values of `gzip.READ` and `gzip.WRITE`.

Now, let's examine the assertions one by one:

- With mode `'r'`:
  ```python
  with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='r') as g:
      self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
  ```
  This test expects the mode to be `gzip.READ`, which seems correct for mode `'r'`.

- With mode `'w'`:
  ```python
  with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='w') as g:
      self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
  ```
  Here's a potential problem. We're opening the gzip file with mode `'w'`, but the test is expecting it to have a mode of `gzip.READ`. This discrepancy should cause a failure.

- With mode `'a'`:
  ```python
  with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='a') as g:
      self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
  ```
  The test expects the mode to be `gzip.WRITE`, which is correct for mode `'a'` (append mode).

- With mode `'x'`:
  ```python
  with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='x') as g:
      self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
  ```
  This tests for the exclusive creation mode, and it expects the mode to be `gzip.WRITE`. This assertion should pass.

- The next test ensures that an invalid mode `'z'` raises a `ValueError`, which seems appropriate.

- For modes `"rb"` and `"r+b"`, the expected gzip mode is `gzip.READ`, which seems correct.

- For modes `"wb"`, `"ab"`, and `"xb"`, the expected gzip mode is `gzip.WRITE`. Before using mode `"xb"`, the file is unlinked (deleted) to ensure that the exclusive creation doesn't fail because of an existing file. Also, a `FutureWarning` is expected when creating the `gzip.GzipFile` with a file object without specifying a mode.

Considering the above analysis, the test will fail at this part:
```python
with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='w') as g:
    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
```
The reason is that the gzip file is opened with mode `'w'`, but the test incorrectly expects it to have a mode of `gzip.READ`.
