Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_fileobj_mode(self):
        gzip.GzipFile(self.filename, "wb").close()
        with open(self.filename, "r+b") as f:
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='r') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='w') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='a') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='x') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
                gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='xbt')
        for mode in "rb", "r+b":
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f) as g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
        for mode in "wb", "ab", "xb":
            if "x" in mode:
                os_helper.unlink(self.filename)
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with self.assertWarns(FutureWarning):
                    g = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f)
                with g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

Let's break down the code and understand each segment of the test:

1. A gzip file is created and closed immediately:
```python
gzip.GzipFile(self.filename, "wb").close()
```

2. The file is opened in `"r+b"` mode (i.e., reading and writing in binary mode). Subsequently, several assertions are made about the mode of the GzipFile object based on the `mode` argument provided to it:

```python
with open(self.filename, "r+b") as f:
    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='r') as g:
        self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
    ...
```

These checks seem to validate if the `GzipFile` object correctly sets its mode based on the mode argument. They seem correct.

3. A check is made to ensure that an invalid mode (in this case, 'xbt') raises a ValueError:

```python
with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
    gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='xbt')
```

This also seems correct, as 'xbt' is not a valid mode for GzipFile.

4. For file modes `"rb"` and `"r+b"`, it checks if the default mode of `GzipFile` is `gzip.READ`:

```python
for mode in "rb", "r+b":
    with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
        with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f) as g:
            self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
```

5. For file modes `"wb"`, `"ab"`, and `"xb"`, it checks if the default mode of `GzipFile` is `gzip.WRITE` and if a `FutureWarning` is raised:

```python
for mode in "wb", "ab", "xb":
    if "x" in mode:
        os_helper.unlink(self.filename)
    with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
        with self.assertWarns(FutureWarning):
            g = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f)
        with g:
            self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
```

The crucial part to note is the `assertWarns(FutureWarning)`. This implies that the Python Standard Library expects to give a warning in the future when the mode isn't explicitly defined for the GzipFile.

Based on the code provided, the only potential pitfalls might be:

- If the default behavior (without explicitly providing a mode) of `gzip.GzipFile` doesn't match the expectations of the test.
- If the library doesn't raise a `FutureWarning` when expected.

Now, based on the Python 3.10 documentation and expected behavior:

- The default mode when creating a `GzipFile` without specifying a mode is 'rb' (read, binary). 
- If a FutureWarning was added after 3.10, then this test would fail for that Python version, but based on the code, it seems to expect such a warning.

Without further details on potential changes in the Python Standard Library after 3.10, it's challenging to predict with certainty if the test will fail.

However, if the test is for Python 3.10 and the behavior of the library hasn't been altered, the test should pass. If there's a discrepancy between the test's expectations and the actual library behavior, then it will fail.
