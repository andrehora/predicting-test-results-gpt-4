Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import gzip
    ...
    def test_fileobj_mode(self):
        gzip.GzipFile(self.filename, "wb").close()
        with open(self.filename, "r+b") as f:
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='r') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='w') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='a') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='x') as g:
                self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
            with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
                gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, mode='zzz')
        for mode in "rb", "r+b":
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f) as g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.READ)
        for mode in "wb", "ab", "xb":
            if "x" in mode:
                os_helper.unlink(self.filename)
            with open(self.filename, mode) as f:
                with self.assertWarns(FutureWarning):
                    g = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f)
                with g:
                    self.assertEqual(g.mode, gzip.WRITE)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The provided test code seems to be testing various modes of `gzip.GzipFile` and their behavior when used in conjunction with an underlying file object.

Let's break down the code piece by piece to understand it and identify if it will pass or fail:

1. **gzip.GzipFile's mode with fileobj:**

    - For mode `r`, it checks if the `gzip.GzipFile` mode is set to `gzip.READ`.
    - For mode `w`, `a`, and `x`, it checks if the `gzip.GzipFile` mode is set to `gzip.WRITE`.
    - It checks if passing an invalid mode like `zzz` raises a `ValueError`.

    So far, these tests seem fine. It's setting up the modes as expected and checks for an invalid mode.

2. **gzip.GzipFile's mode without specifying mode (with underlying file object's mode):**

    - For modes `rb` and `r+b`, it checks if the `gzip.GzipFile` mode is set to `gzip.READ`.
    - For modes `wb`, `ab`, and `xb`, it expects a `FutureWarning` to be raised when the `gzip.GzipFile` is instantiated and checks if its mode is `gzip.WRITE`. This suggests that in the future, the behavior of inferring the mode from the underlying file object might be deprecated or changed.

The only potential pitfall I see here is the assumption of a `FutureWarning` being raised for the modes `wb`, `ab`, and `xb`. If the Python Standard Library in version 3.10 does not raise this warning, this test would fail.

Given the information provided and without more context (like the exact behavior of the Python 3.10 Standard Library), the test seems well-formed. The primary point of contention would be the `FutureWarning`. 

You would need to consult the official Python 3.10 documentation for `gzip.GzipFile` to see if this warning is indeed raised in these scenarios. If it's not, that part of the test will fail. If it is, the test should pass (assuming there are no hidden issues).
