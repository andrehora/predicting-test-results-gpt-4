Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line,1', 'line,2', 'line,3'])
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

This test case is testing the `line_num` attribute of a `csv.reader` object, which provides the current line number.

Let's walk through the test step by step:

1. A `csv.reader` object `r` is created with three lines of input.
2. Initially, `r.line_num` should be `0`, so the first assertion should pass.
3. After reading the first line with `next(r)`, the line number should be incremented to `1`, so the second assertion should pass.
4. Similarly, after reading the second line, `r.line_num` should be incremented to `2`, so the third assertion should pass.
5. Now, here's the trickier part. After reading the third and final line with `next(r)`, what will be the value of `r.line_num`? The test expects it to remain `2`. If this assumption is correct, then the fourth assertion will pass.
6. The next call to `next(r)` is expected to raise a `StopIteration` exception since there are no more lines to read. This is being checked with `self.assertRaises`, so if this behavior is consistent with the `csv.reader`, this assertion will pass.
7. Lastly, after the `StopIteration` exception, the test expects `r.line_num` to remain `2`, and the final assertion checks this.

Given this breakdown, the key point of contention is the behavior of the `line_num` attribute after reading the last line and after the `StopIteration` exception. In the Python 3.10 Standard Library's `csv.reader` implementation, the `line_num` attribute is incremented after a line is successfully read. 

Therefore, the test case seems to have an error in its expectations:

1. After reading the third line, the `line_num` will actually be incremented to `3`, so the fourth assertion (`self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)`) will fail.
2. The rest of the assertions after the failed one might not be executed depending on the test runner, but if they were to be executed, the sixth assertion (`self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)`) would also fail for the same reason.

In conclusion, the test will fail at the fourth assertion because the expected line number is incorrect.
