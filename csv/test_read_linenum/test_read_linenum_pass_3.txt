Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line1', 'line2', 'line3'])
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The provided test is checking the `line_num` attribute of the `csv.reader` object.

Here's a breakdown of the test:

1. A `csv.reader` object `r` is created with a list of 3 strings.
2. The test asserts that `r.line_num` is initially `0`.
3. After reading the first line using `next(r)`, the test asserts that `r.line_num` has increased to `1`.
4. Similarly, the test checks for lines 2 and 3.
5. Finally, the test asserts that a `StopIteration` exception is raised after trying to read past the end of the input, and checks that `r.line_num` remains at `3`.

The Python Standard Library documentation for `csv.reader` states:

> reader.line_num
>
> The number of lines read from the source iterator. This is not the same as the number of records returned, as records can span multiple lines.

Considering this, the behavior of `line_num` as tested in the provided code should work correctly. Every time `next(r)` is called, the `line_num` should increment by 1, and the behavior is consistent with the test.

Thus, the test should **pass** based on the expected behavior of the `csv.reader` object in the Python Standard Library version 3.10.
