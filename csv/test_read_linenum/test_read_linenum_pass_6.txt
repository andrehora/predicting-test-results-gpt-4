Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line,1'])
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

This is a test for the `csv.reader` object in the Python Standard Library. Let's break down what's happening:

1. A `csv.reader` object is initialized with a list containing one string `'line,1'`.
2. The initial line number (`r.line_num`) is checked to be 0.
3. The `next(r)` call fetches the first (and only) line from the reader.
4. The line number is checked again, and it should now be 1 since we've read one line.
5. We're expecting a `StopIteration` exception when calling `next(r)` again because there's only one line in the input.
6. After this, the line number is checked again and expected to be 1.

This test seems to be checking the behavior of the `line_num` attribute of a `csv.reader` object, especially its increment after reading a line and how it remains unchanged after a `StopIteration` exception.

From the Python Standard Library's documentation:

> `reader.line_num`: The number of lines read from the source iterator. This is not the same as the number of records returned, as records can span multiple lines.

Given the above behavior, this test should pass. Here's why:

1. Initially, `r.line_num` is 0 because no lines have been read.
2. After reading one line, `r.line_num` becomes 1.
3. Even after the `StopIteration` exception, `r.line_num` remains 1 because no new lines have been read.

Therefore, the test is likely to pass as the behavior described in the test matches the documented behavior of the `csv.reader` object's `line_num` attribute.
