Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line,1', 'line,2', 'line,3'])
        line_num = 0
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, line_num)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, line_num+1)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, line_num+2)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, line_num+3)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, line_num+3)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test you provided is examining the behavior of the `line_num` attribute of a `csv.reader` object.

Let's analyze the test step by step:

1. A `csv.reader` object `r` is created with a list of three strings, simulating three lines of CSV data.

2. A local variable `line_num` is initialized to 0.

3. The current line number of the reader (`r.line_num`) is asserted to be equal to `line_num` (which is 0). This should pass since the reader starts at the beginning.

4. The `next(r)` function is called once, which moves the reader to the next line. So, the line number should now be 1.

5. It is asserted that `r.line_num` is equal to `line_num + 1`. Given that `line_num` is 0, this asserts that `r.line_num` is 1. This should pass.

6. The `next(r)` function is called again, moving the reader to the next line. The line number should now be 2.

7. It is asserted that `r.line_num` is equal to `line_num + 2`. This asserts that `r.line_num` is 2. This should pass.

8. The `next(r)` function is called once more, moving the reader to the next line. The line number should now be 3.

9. It is asserted that `r.line_num` is equal to `line_num + 3`. This asserts that `r.line_num` is 3. This should pass.

10. The `next(r)` function is called again, but there are no more lines left. So, this should raise a `StopIteration` exception.

11. After the `StopIteration` exception is raised, the code asserts that `r.line_num` is still equal to `line_num + 3`. This should pass, as the line number should not change after reaching the end.

Given the behavior described in the Python documentation for `csv.reader` regarding the `line_num` attribute and assuming there are no hidden surprises in the "..." portion of the code you provided, the test should pass.
