Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line,1', 'line,2'])
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

This test is checking the behavior of the `line_num` attribute of the `csv.reader` object. Let's break it down step by step:

1. `r = csv.reader(['line,1', 'line,2'])`: Creates a new CSV reader instance that will read from the provided list of strings.
  
2. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)`: This checks if the initial line number of the reader is 0. This should be true, as the reader hasn't read any lines yet.

3. `next(r)`: Reads the first line from the reader.

4. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)`: Checks if the line number after reading the first line is 1. This should be true, as we've read the first line.

5. `next(r)`: Reads the second line from the reader.

6. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)`: Checks if the line number after reading the second line is 2. This should be true, as we've now read two lines.

7. `self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)`: Tries to read the next line from the reader, but there are no more lines left. This should raise a `StopIteration` exception. This check should pass, as it's expected behavior when there are no more lines left to read.

8. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)`: Checks if the line number remains 2 after attempting to read past the end of the input. It should remain 2 since it still reflects the number of lines that have been read.

Based on this analysis, the test appears to be correct, and it should pass given the expected behavior of the `csv.reader` object's `line_num` attribute. If the Python Standard Library's implementation is consistent with this behavior, then the test will pass.
