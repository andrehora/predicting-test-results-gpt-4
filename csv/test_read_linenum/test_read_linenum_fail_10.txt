Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line1 line2 line3'])
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the code and understand what it is doing.

The test involves the `csv.reader` object and its attribute `line_num`, which provides the current line number being processed.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

1. A `csv.reader` object `r` is created with a single string `['line1 line2 line3']`. It should be noted that this is a single string within a list, so there's just one line for the `csv.reader` to process. 

2. Initially, the `line_num` attribute is 0, since no lines have been read:
   ```python
   self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
   ```

3. We then call `next(r)`, which reads the next line. In this case, it reads the only line, i.e., `'line1 line2 line3'`. So, the `line_num` should be 1:
   ```python
   next(r)
   self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
   ```

4. After this, there are no more lines to be read. So, the subsequent calls to `next(r)` will raise a `StopIteration` exception. The test, however, continues to call `next(r)` two more times and checks the value of `line_num`:

   ```python
   next(r)
   self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)

   next(r)
   self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
   ```

   Here lies the problem: the subsequent calls to `next(r)` should raise a `StopIteration` exception immediately, so `r.line_num` should not increase to 2 or 3.

5. Finally, the test checks that a `StopIteration` is raised when trying to get the next item from the reader:

   ```python
   self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
   ```

   This check is correct, as we are expecting a `StopIteration` exception at this point.

6. It then asserts that `r.line_num` is still 3:
   ```python
   self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
   ```

   But as mentioned, `r.line_num` should not have gone beyond 1.

In conclusion, the test will fail. The `line_num` should remain at 1 after reading the only line present in the input list. The assertions expecting `line_num` to be 2 and 3 are incorrect.
