Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line,10', 'line,20', 'line,30'])
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test:

1. A `csv.reader` object is created to read from a list of strings: `['line,10', 'line,20', 'line,30']`.

2. The test checks the `line_num` attribute of the `r` object. This attribute should give the number of lines read so far.

3. The `next` function is used to read the lines from the `r` object. Each time `next(r)` is called, a line is read from the `csv.reader` object.

Given this, let's walk through the test:

1. After initializing the `csv.reader`, the `line_num` is checked to be 0.
   
2. After reading the first line, the `line_num` should be 1.

3. After reading the second line, the `line_num` should be 2.

4. After reading the third line, the `line_num` should be 3.

5. Attempting to read another line should raise a `StopIteration` error because there are no more lines to read. The test then checks if the `line_num` is still 3 after the `StopIteration` is raised.

Given the described behavior of the `csv.reader`'s `line_num` attribute in the Python Standard Library documentation, the test should pass.

However, if there was a discrepancy in the behavior of the `csv.reader`'s `line_num` attribute or any mistake in how the `csv.reader` is utilized in this test, then it would fail.

Based on the provided code and the expected behavior of the `csv.reader` object, this test should pass. If it doesn't, then there might be a bug or undocumented behavior in the Python Standard Library (though this would be quite rare).
