Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line,1,2', 'line,2,3', 'line,3,4'])
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The provided test case is attempting to verify the behavior of the `line_num` attribute of a CSV reader object.

Here's a breakdown of the test:

1. A CSV reader object `r` is created with a list of strings simulating 3 CSV lines.
2. The initial value of `line_num` is asserted to be `0`.
3. After reading the first line with `next(r)`, `line_num` is expected to be `1`.
4. After reading the second line, it is expected to be `2`.
5. After reading the third line, it is expected to be `3`.
6. Another `next(r)` would raise a `StopIteration` since there are no more lines to read. This is being checked using the `assertRaises` method.
7. Finally, it is checked that `line_num` remains `3` after the `StopIteration` exception.

Based on the Python documentation for the `csv.reader` object (as of Python 3.10):
- The `line_num` attribute of a `csv.reader` object provides the number of lines read from the source iterator.

This suggests that the behavior being tested should be correct. After each call to `next(r)`, the `line_num` should increase by one, and when there are no more lines to read, a `StopIteration` exception should be raised.

Therefore, this test is expected to pass.
