Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line,1', 'line,2'])
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the given test case for the `csv.reader`:

1. A reader `r` is created with the input list `['line,1', 'line,2']`.
2. It checks the initial value of `r.line_num`, which should be `0` since no lines have been read yet. 
3. It reads the first line using `next(r)`, and checks that `r.line_num` is `1`.
4. It reads the second line using `next(r)`, and checks that `r.line_num` is `2`.
5. It then attempts to read a third line using `next(r)`, but there isn't a third line in the list. At this point, the reader should raise a `StopIteration` exception.
6. It checks the value of `r.line_num` again after the `StopIteration` exception.

Given the above breakdown, the main point of contention in this test is the value of `r.line_num` after the `StopIteration` exception is raised.

Now, let's address the assertions in order:

1. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)` - This should pass as initially, no lines have been read.
2. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)` - This should pass after reading the first line.
3. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)` - This should pass after reading the second line.
4. `next(r)` - Attempting to read the third line will raise a `StopIteration` exception as there are only two lines in the list.
5. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)` - This assertion expects that `r.line_num` increments even when `next(r)` raises `StopIteration`. This might be the problematic part of the test.
6. `self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)` - This checks if a `StopIteration` exception is raised when trying to read past the end, which should pass.
7. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)` - This again checks the line number after the exception.

The problematic part of this test is the expectation that `r.line_num` will be incremented when a `StopIteration` exception is raised.

Based on my knowledge, the `csv.reader` will not increment the `line_num` attribute if the attempt to read a line raises a `StopIteration` exception.

Therefore, the assertion:
```python
self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
```
will fail. The correct value of `r.line_num` after reading the two lines and attempting to read a third should still be `2`. The test incorrectly expects it to be `3`.

In conclusion, the test will fail because of the incorrect expectation about the value of `r.line_num` after a `StopIteration` exception is raised.
