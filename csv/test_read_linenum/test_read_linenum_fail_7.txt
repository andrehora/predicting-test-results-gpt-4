Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line,1', 'line,2', 'line,3', 'line,4'])
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the given code:

1. A `csv.reader` object `r` is created with an iterable of 4 strings.
2. Initially, the line number is checked, and it's expected to be 0. (This is true before reading any line.)
3. After reading the first line using `next(r)`, the line number is checked to be 1.
4. After reading the second line, the line number is checked to be 2.
5. After reading the third line, the line number is checked to be 3.
6. The test then tries to read the next line from the `csv.reader` object using `next(r)`, but there is no line after the third one, so it expects a `StopIteration` exception.
7. Finally, it checks the line number again expecting it to be 3.

There seems to be a mistake in the given code. The `csv.reader` object is created with 4 strings, which means there are 4 lines. After reading the third line, there's still one more line (`'line,4'`) left to read. So, the code will not raise the `StopIteration` exception at that point.

Instead, the `StopIteration` would be raised after trying to read the line after the fourth line.

To fix this test, you would need to call `next(r)` one more time before expecting the `StopIteration` exception:

```python
    ...
    next(r)
    self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
    next(r)  # Reading the fourth line.
    self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 4)
    self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)  # Now it raises StopIteration.
    self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 4)
```

So, the answer is: The test will fail because it incorrectly expects a `StopIteration` exception after reading only 3 out of the 4 provided lines.
