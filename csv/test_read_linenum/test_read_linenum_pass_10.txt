Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line,,1', 'line,,2', 'line,,3'])
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test is examining the behavior of the `line_num` attribute of a `csv.reader` object. The attribute keeps track of the number of lines the reader has processed.

Let's break down the test step by step:

1. `r = csv.reader(['line,,1', 'line,,2', 'line,,3'])`: Creates a new `csv.reader` object from a list of strings.

2. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)`: Initially, no lines have been read, so `line_num` should be 0. This check should pass.

3. `next(r)`: Reads the first line (`'line,,1'`). After this, `line_num` should be 1.

4. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)`: Checks if `line_num` is 1 after reading the first line. This check should pass.

5. `next(r)`: Reads the second line (`'line,,2'`). Now, `line_num` should be 2.

6. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)`: Checks if `line_num` is 2 after reading the second line. This check should pass.

7. `next(r)`: Reads the third line (`'line,,3'`). After this, `line_num` should be 3.

8. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)`: Checks if `line_num` is 3 after reading the third line. This check should pass.

9. `self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)`: Tries to read another line from the reader. Since there are no more lines left, this should raise a `StopIteration` exception. This check should pass.

10. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)`: Checks that the `line_num` hasn't changed after attempting to read beyond the last line. This should still be 3, so this check should pass.

Given the above breakdown and assuming that there are no syntax errors or issues outside the provided code (like with the omitted `import` statement or the test framework being used), the test should pass without any failures.
