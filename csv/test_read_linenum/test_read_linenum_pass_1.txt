Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line,0', 'line,2', 'line,3'])
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test provided is designed to evaluate the behavior of the `line_num` attribute of the `csv.reader` object.

To determine if this test will pass or fail, let's break down the code:

1. `r = csv.reader(['line,0', 'line,2', 'line,3'])`: Here, a `csv.reader` object `r` is created from a list of strings. Each string represents a line of CSV content.

2. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)`: Before reading any line, the `line_num` should be 0.

3. `next(r)`: Reads the first line `'line,0'`.

4. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)`: After reading the first line, the `line_num` should be 1.

5. `next(r)`: Reads the second line `'line,2'`.

6. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)`: After reading the second line, the `line_num` should be 2.

7. `next(r)`: Reads the third line `'line,3'`.

8. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)`: After reading the third line, the `line_num` should be 3.

9. `self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)`: This line tries to read another entry from the `csv.reader` object. However, there are no more lines to read, so this should raise a `StopIteration` exception.

10. `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)`: The `line_num` should remain 3, even after an attempt to read past the end of the data.

Based on the described behavior of the `csv.reader` object's `line_num` attribute and the steps in the provided test, the test should pass if the `csv.reader` behaves as described. However, to be absolutely certain, you'd want to run the test in a Python environment with the specified version.
