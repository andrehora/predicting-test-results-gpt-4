Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    ...
    def test_read_linenum(self):
        r = csv.reader(['line,1 line,2 line,3'])
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 0)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 1)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)
        next(r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
        self.assertRaises(StopIteration, next, r)
        self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 3)
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The given test is attempting to verify the behavior of the `line_num` attribute of a CSV reader object. Let's break down the test:

1. A CSV reader object `r` is created to read from a list containing a single string `'line,1 line,2 line,3'`. 
2. The initial value of `r.line_num` is checked to be 0.
3. The `next` function is called on `r` three times, and after each call, the value of `r.line_num` is checked.
4. After reading all rows, a `StopIteration` exception is expected, and the value of `r.line_num` should still be 3.

The potential issue in this test is the assumption made about how the CSV reader will treat the single string `'line,1 line,2 line,3'`.

If the CSV reader treats each space as a delimiter between fields (and not as a newline), the test will fail. The reason is that the CSV reader will see the input as a single row with multiple fields rather than as three separate rows.

Let's analyze the steps:

1. `r.line_num` starts as 0. This step will pass.
2. After the first call to `next(r)`, the entire string `'line,1 line,2 line,3'` will be read as one row. At this point, `r.line_num` will be 1. This step will pass.
3. The next call to `next(r)` will raise a `StopIteration` exception because there are no more rows to read. Therefore, the test will fail at this line: `self.assertEqual(r.line_num, 2)`.

In conclusion, the test will fail because it incorrectly assumes that the CSV reader will treat spaces in the input string as newlines. The correct behavior of the CSV reader in this scenario is to treat the entire string as a single row, causing `r.line_num` to be 1 after reading it.
