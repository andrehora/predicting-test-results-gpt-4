Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), ",10,abc\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's analyze the test method `test_write_simple_dict`.

1. It creates a temporary file using `TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='')`. This file is opened in write and read mode (`w+`) with UTF-8 encoding and without any newline transformation (`newline=''`).

2. A `csv.DictWriter` is then created with fieldnames as `["f1", "f2", "f3"]`.

3. The writer's `writeheader()` method is used to write the header. So, the content of the file should be "f1,f2,f3\r\n" after this.

4. We then reset the file's cursor position to the beginning using `fileobj.seek(0)` and then read the first line with `fileobj.readline()`. The test checks if this line matches "f1,f2,f3\r\n". This check should pass.

5. Next, `writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})` writes a row to the file. Given the dictionary, the resulting row in the CSV should be "10,,abc\r\n" (because there's no "f2" key in the provided dictionary).

6. We reset the cursor to the beginning again and skip the header by reading it with `fileobj.readline()`.

7. The next `self.assertEqual` checks the content of the file after the header. This is where the problem arises. The test expects the content to be ",10,abc\r\n", but based on the dictionary written, it should actually be "10,,abc\r\n".

So, the test will fail at the last `self.assertEqual` assertion. The reason for the failure is the discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output from writing the dictionary to the CSV.
