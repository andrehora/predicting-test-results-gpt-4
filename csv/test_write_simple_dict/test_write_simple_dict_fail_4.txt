Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,aaa\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test appears to be checking the functionality of the `csv.DictWriter` class in writing dictionary data to a CSV file. Let's break down the test:

1. It creates a temporary file.
2. A `csv.DictWriter` object is created with specified fieldnames.
3. It writes the header to the file.
4. It verifies that the header is correctly written.
5. It writes a row to the file using `writer.writerow`.
6. It verifies that the row is correctly written.

Upon examining the test, it seems there's an inconsistency:

The dictionary given for writing the row is: `{"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"}`

However, the expected output for the row is: `"10,,aaa\r\n"`

The inconsistency here is that the dictionary specifies the value for "f3" to be "abc", but the expected output in the test checks for "aaa". 

So, the test will fail at the line:
```python
self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,aaa\r\n")
```

The correct expectation should be:
```python
self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc\r\n")
```

To conclude, the test will fail due to a mismatch in the expected value and the actual value written to the CSV file.
