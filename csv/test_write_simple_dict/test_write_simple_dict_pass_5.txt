Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test is attempting to write a header and a single dictionary row to a temporary file using the `csv.DictWriter` and then verify its content.

Let's break down the test step by step:

1. A temporary file is created with write and read mode, utf-8 encoding, and newline handling set to empty string. This means the `csv` module handles the newline characters.

2. A `csv.DictWriter` object is created with fieldnames "f1" and "f2".

3. The header is written using `writer.writeheader()`, which would write "f1,f2\r\n" to the file.

4. The file's position is reset to the beginning using `fileobj.seek(0)`, and the header is read and checked against the expected value "f1,f2\r\n". This should pass.

5. A single row is written with only the "f1" field populated. The output for this row would be "10,\r\n".

6. The file's position is again reset to the beginning, and the header line is read and discarded. The test then reads the rest of the file and checks if it matches "10,\r\n".

The given steps and assertions look correct. The test should write "f1,f2\r\n10,\r\n" to the temporary file, and the assertions are checking the contents accordingly.

So, the test should pass.
