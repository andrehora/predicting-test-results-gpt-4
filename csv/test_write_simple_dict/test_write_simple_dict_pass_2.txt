Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f2", "f1", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f2,f1,f3\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), ",10,abc\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test to understand its flow:

1. A temporary file is created with write and read permissions. It is encoded in utf-8 and uses newline handling specific for CSV files.

2. A `csv.DictWriter` object is created with the fieldnames `["f2", "f1", "f3"]`.

3. The headers (`f2,f1,f3`) are written to the file.

4. The file's read-write head is moved to the beginning of the file.

5. The test checks if the first line in the file matches the header string "f2,f1,f3\r\n". This should pass as the header is written correctly.

6. A new row is written using `writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})`. 

   The data provided is:
   ```
   f1: 10
   f3: abc
   ```
   Notice that the value for `f2` is missing. In a CSV, if a field is missing, its position will have no value, but the delimiter will still be present. 

7. The file's read-write head is moved to the beginning of the file again.

8. The header line is read and discarded (to position the read-write head at the start of the data rows).

9. The test then checks if the remaining content of the file matches the string ",10,abc\r\n".

Let's manually generate the expected CSV content based on the given data:

```
f2,f1,f3\r\n
,10,abc\r\n
```

Given that the expected result matches the content the test checks for, the test should pass.
