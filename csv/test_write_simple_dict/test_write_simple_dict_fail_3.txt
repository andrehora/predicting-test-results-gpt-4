Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "aaa"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

This test will fail.

Let's break down the test:

1. A temporary file is created with write and read permissions (`w+` mode) and is set to use UTF-8 encoding. The `newline=''` ensures that the writer writes newlines as `\r\n`.

2. A `csv.DictWriter` object is created with field names `["f1", "f2", "f3"]`.

3. The header is written using `writer.writeheader()`, which will write `f1,f2,f3\r\n` to the file.

4. The file's position is reset to the beginning using `fileobj.seek(0)`, and the test checks if the header is correctly written. This part of the test will pass.

5. Next, a row is written using `writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "aaa"})`.

6. The file's position is reset to the beginning again using `fileobj.seek(0)` and the header is read using `fileobj.readline()` to skip it.

7. Finally, the test checks if the remaining content of the file is `"10,,abc\r\n"`. This is where the test will fail. The reason is that the row that was written was `{"f1": 10, "f3": "aaa"}`, so the correct content should be `"10,,aaa\r\n"` and not `"10,,abc\r\n"`.

Thus, the test will fail at the last assertion due to the incorrect expected value. The correct line of the test should be:
```python
self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,aaa\r\n")
```
