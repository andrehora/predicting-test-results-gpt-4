Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 100, "f3": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "100,,abc\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test:

1. A temporary file `fileobj` is created with write and read mode (`w+`) with UTF-8 encoding and newline handling.
2. A `DictWriter` is created with the fieldnames "f1", "f2", and "f3".
3. `writer.writeheader()` is called, which writes the headers ("f1,f2,f3") followed by a newline to the temporary file.
4. The file's seek position is reset to the beginning using `fileobj.seek(0)`.
5. The first line (header) is read and checked against the string "f1,f2,f3\r\n". This check will pass because that's the expected header.
6. `writer.writerow({"f2": 10})` writes a dictionary with a value for "f2" but not for "f1" and "f3". The DictWriter will write empty fields for "f1" and "f3", so the output for this row will be ",10," followed by a newline.
7. The file's seek position is reset to the beginning again using `fileobj.seek(0)`.
8. The header line is read (but not checked).
9. The remaining part of the file is read and checked against the string ",10,\r\n". 

Given the described behavior of the `DictWriter`, the test should pass as the expected output matches the actual output written to the temporary file.

Therefore, the test will pass.
