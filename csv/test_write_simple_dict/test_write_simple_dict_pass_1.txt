Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f0", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f0,f2,f3\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f0": 10, "f3": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test `test_write_simple_dict` to see what it does:

1. A temporary file is created with the mode "w+", encoding set to "utf-8", and newline set to an empty string. 
   - "w+" means the file is opened for both writing and reading.
   - Setting the newline to an empty string is crucial when working with CSV files to make sure newlines are handled in a consistent manner across different platforms.

2. A `csv.DictWriter` object is instantiated for writing dictionaries to the file with specified fieldnames "f0", "f2", and "f3".

3. The header is written using `writer.writeheader()`. Given the fieldnames, the header should be "f0,f2,f3\r\n".

4. The file position is set to the start using `fileobj.seek(0)`. The next line checks if the header was written correctly, expecting the line to be "f0,f2,f3\r\n".

5. A row is written using `writer.writerow({"f0": 10, "f3": "abc"})`. Since only "f0" and "f3" are provided, the resulting row should be "10,,abc\r\n".

6. The file position is reset to the start again using `fileobj.seek(0)`. The header is read and discarded.

7. The test then checks if the row was written correctly, expecting the content of the file (minus the header) to be "10,,abc\r\n".

Given the explanation, the test seems to be correctly checking the expected behavior of `csv.DictWriter`. It first checks if the header is correctly written and then checks if the dictionary is written as a row correctly.

Assuming that there's no bug in the `csv` module of the Python Standard Library version 3.10, and given the test's context, the test should pass.
