Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,abc,\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test is essentially verifying that a simple dictionary can be written to a temporary file using the `csv.DictWriter` class.

Let's break down the test step by step:

1. A temporary file is created using the `TemporaryFile` context manager. The file is opened in "w+" mode (read and write), with an encoding of "utf-8" and newline set to an empty string. This means that the file will handle its own newlines, which is recommended when working with the `csv` module to ensure that newlines inside and outside quoted fields are interpreted correctly.
  
2. A `csv.DictWriter` instance is created with the given field names ["f1", "f2", "f3"].

3. The `writeheader` method of the `DictWriter` instance is called to write the header to the file. The file cursor is then moved to the start of the file and the header is read back and checked. This check is expected to pass.

4. A row is written to the file using the `writerow` method, providing values for the "f1" and "f3" fields. The "f2" field is not provided a value.

5. The file cursor is moved back to the beginning, and the header line is read (but not checked since it was already checked earlier). Then, the file is read to the end and checked.

The expected output of the row write operation is `"10,abc,\r\n"`. This means:

- "f1" has a value of `10`
- "f2" does not have a value, so it remains empty
- "f3" has a value of `abc`

This looks correct. The newline sequence "\r\n" is consistent with the CSV format's standard newline sequence on many platforms, and since the `newline` parameter was set to an empty string when the file was opened, it should ensure that newlines are handled correctly.

Given the provided information, I believe that the test will pass.
