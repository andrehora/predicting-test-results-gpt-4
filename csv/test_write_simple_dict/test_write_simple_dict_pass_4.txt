Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline()
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's go through the test step-by-step:

1. The test is importing the required modules: `csv` and `TemporaryFile` from `tempfile`.
2. It defines a test function `test_write_simple_dict`.
3. Within this function, it creates a temporary file with write and read permissions (`"w+"`) and specifies encoding as UTF-8. The `newline=''` parameter ensures that the writer doesnâ€™t output any extra newlines.
4. A `DictWriter` object is created with the field names as `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`.
5. The headers are written to the file using `writer.writeheader()`. This should result in `"f1,f2,f3\r\n"` being written to the file.
6. The file's seek position is reset to the beginning using `fileobj.seek(0)`.
7. The next line reads and checks the header we wrote earlier. This should pass since the header has been correctly written.
8. Next, a row is written using `writer.writerow`. Since the row dictionary doesn't have a value for `f2`, it should produce a line with an empty field in the middle: `"10,,abc\r\n"`.
9. The file's seek position is reset again and the header line is read and discarded.
10. The test checks the content of the remaining file against the expected value.

From the provided code and the way the `csv.DictWriter` works, the test should pass. The written content matches the expected content in the assertions.

However, potential issues can be external factors such as:
- File write permissions: If, for some reason, the temporary file cannot be written to, there could be an error.
- Disk space: If the disk is full, writing to a temporary file may fail.
- External changes to the CSV module: If there have been modifications or updates to the `csv` module after Python 3.10 that change its behavior, it could cause an error (though this is less likely).

Given only the code provided and assuming a standard environment and no modifications to the Python Standard Library, the test should pass.
