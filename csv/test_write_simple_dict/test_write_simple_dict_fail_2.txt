Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test is expected to fail. Let's break it down:

1. A temporary file `fileobj` is created for writing and reading with UTF-8 encoding and newline handling appropriate for CSV files.
2. A `DictWriter` object is created with the fieldnames `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`.
3. The headers are written to the file with the method `writeheader()`.
4. The file pointer is reset to the start of the file.
5. The test asserts that the header line is `"f1,f2\r\n"`, but this is incorrect.

The actual header should be `"f1,f2,f3\r\n"`, as all three fieldnames would be written as the header. This means that the first `self.assertEqual` will fail.

6. A dictionary with keys `f1` and `f3` is written to the CSV file.
7. The file pointer is reset to the start and the header line is read (and ignored).
8. The test asserts that the next line in the file is `"10,,abc\r\n"`, and this is correct. For the missing `f2` field, the DictWriter will insert an empty value between the commas.

To fix the test, change the first assertion to:
```python
self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3\r\n")
```

After making this change, the test should pass.
