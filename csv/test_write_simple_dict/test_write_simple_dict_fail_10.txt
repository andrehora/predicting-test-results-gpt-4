Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test provided is designed to test writing to a CSV file using `csv.DictWriter` and then reading back from it to validate the content. Let's walk through the code to determine if it will pass or fail:

1. A temporary file `fileobj` is created with write and read permissions, using UTF-8 encoding and specifying `newline=''`.
   
2. A `csv.DictWriter` object `writer` is created with fieldnames `["f1", "f2", "f3"]`.

3. The header is written using `writer.writeheader()`, so the temporary file will have the contents:
```
f1,f2,f3
```

4. The file pointer is reset to the beginning using `fileobj.seek(0)`.

5. The next line reads the header and checks if it's equal to `"f1,f2,f3"`. This should pass as it matches the header we just wrote.

6. A row is written with values for `f1` and `f3` only using `writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})`. The CSV should now look like:
```
f1,f2,f3
10,,abc
```
The missing value for `f2` is represented by the consecutive commas.

7. The file pointer is reset again to the start of the file, and then the header is read and discarded.

8. The remaining content of the file is read and checked if it's equal to `"10,,abc\r\n"`. This is where a potential issue may arise. The ending `"\r\n"` denotes a Windows-style line ending, but the `newline=''` argument in `TemporaryFile` creation allows the csv module to handle the newlines in a platform-specific manner. This means that on non-Windows platforms, the newline might just be `"\n"`.

Conclusion:
The test will pass on Windows systems but will fail on platforms where the newline is represented solely by `"\n"`, like UNIX or Linux, because the test expects the Windows-specific `"\r\n"` line ending.

To make the test platform-independent, you should not hard-code the expected newline characters. Instead, you can use `os.linesep` to get the appropriate line ending for the current platform:

```python
import os
...
self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), f"10,,abc{os.linesep}")
```
