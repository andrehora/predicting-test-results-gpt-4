Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f11", "f22", "f33"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f11,f22,f33\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f11": 10, "f33": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test given writes a CSV using the `csv.DictWriter` and reads it back to verify if the contents are as expected. 

Let's break down the test:

1. A temporary file `fileobj` is created with "w+" mode, so it's both readable and writable. `newline=''` ensures that the newlines aren't translated, so we can directly check for `"\r\n"`.

2. A `DictWriter` object is instantiated with the fieldnames "f11", "f22", and "f33".

3. The `writeheader` method writes the headers to the file.

4. The file's position is reset to the beginning using `fileobj.seek(0)`.

5. The next line reads the first line of the file (which should be the header) and checks if it matches `"f11,f22,f33\r\n"`. If it does not, the test would fail at this point. 

6. The `writerow` method is called with a dictionary that has values for "f11" and "f33". Notice that "f22" is missing. `DictWriter` handles this by leaving the value empty for "f22".

7. The file's position is again reset to the beginning using `fileobj.seek(0)`.

8. The header is read and discarded using `fileobj.readline()`.

9. The test checks if the remaining contents of the file match `"10,,abc\r\n"`. This would be `10` for "f11", an empty value for "f22", and `abc` for "f33".

At first glance, the test appears to be correctly written and should pass. The CSV writing and reading operations seem to match the expected output.

However, there's a small oversight in the test which will cause it to fail. The `writeheader` method writes a newline character after the header, and `writerow` method writes another newline character after the data row. But when the file position is reset using `seek(0)` after writing the header, the data row written using `writerow` will overwrite the newline character of the header, leading to a continuous line: `"f11,f22,f33\r\n10,,abc\r\n"`. Hence, `fileobj.readline()` after the `seek(0)` would read the entire content of the file, making the subsequent `read()` call return an empty string.

To fix this, a call to `fileobj.flush()` should be added after `writer.writeheader()` to ensure that the header is completely written to the file before proceeding.

```python
writer.writeheader()
fileobj.flush()
```

Without this fix, the test will fail at the last assertion since it would not find the expected data row string.
