Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc\r")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test provided is attempting to check the correctness of writing a dictionary to a CSV file using the `csv.DictWriter` class. Let's break down the test and see if it is valid:

1. A temporary file is created with write and read permissions. The encoding is set to "utf-8" and the newline character is set to an empty string. The newline argument is crucial for controlling newline characters when writing to a CSV file.
2. A `DictWriter` instance is created with fieldnames set to ["f1", "f2", "f3"].
3. The header row is written to the file using `writeheader()` and then the file's pointer is reset to the start using `seek(0)`.
4. The first row from the file (the header) is read and checked against the expected "f1,f2,f3\r\n".
5. A new row is written using `writerow()` where only "f1" and "f3" are provided values.
6. The file's pointer is reset again and the header is read to skip over it.
7. The content of the file after the header is read and checked against the expected value "10,,abc\r".

The expected issue in the test arises from the line:
```python
self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc\r")
```
When using the `csv` module in Python, the default line terminator is `\r\n` (a carriage return followed by a newline). Since the `newline` argument in `TemporaryFile` is set to an empty string, the csv writer will use the default line terminator. Therefore, the correct output for the written row would be "10,,abc\r\n" and not "10,,abc\r".

Thus, the test will fail at the last `assertEqual` statement. The corrected line should be:
```python
self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc\r\n")
```
