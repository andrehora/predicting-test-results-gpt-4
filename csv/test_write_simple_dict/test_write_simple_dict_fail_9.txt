Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3\r")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The given test is trying to write a CSV header and a single row using `csv.DictWriter`. Let's walk through the code step by step to determine if it will pass or fail.

1. A temporary file is opened in read/write mode with encoding set to "utf-8" and newline handling set to an empty string.
2. A `DictWriter` is created with fieldnames ["f1", "f2", "f3"].
3. The CSV header is written using `writer.writeheader()`.
4. The file's position is reset to the start using `fileobj.seek(0)`.
5. The header is read from the file and asserted to be equal to "f1,f2,f3\r".
6. A row is written with only "f1" and "f3" filled in.
7. The file's position is again reset to the start and the header line is read (and discarded).
8. The next line (the data row) is read and asserted to be equal to "10,,abc\r\n".

Now, let's see if the assertions match the expected values:

1. The header should indeed be "f1,f2,f3\r\n" on a system where the default newline is "\r\n". However, the test is asserting it to be "f1,f2,f3\r". This will cause an assertion error. The newline after the header is "\r\n" due to the `newline=''` setting when opening the file, but the test is expecting only "\r".
   
2. For the row data, since only "f1" and "f3" are provided, the "f2" field should be empty. The assertion seems to be correct here: "10,,abc\r\n".

Given the above points, the test will **fail** at the first assertion because it expects the header's newline to be "\r" instead of the correct "\r\n".
