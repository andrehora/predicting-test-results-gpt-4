Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The given test is intended to check the functioning of the `csv.DictWriter` class. Let's analyze the test step by step:

1. It's creating a temporary file using `TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='')`. Here:
   - `"w+"` mode is for both writing and reading.
   - `encoding="utf-8"` specifies that the file will use UTF-8 encoding.
   - `newline=''` means that newlines will be handled in a way that's suitable for CSV files (i.e., a simple newline character will represent a newline, regardless of the platform).

2. A `DictWriter` object is then created with the specified fieldnames.

3. The header is written using `writeheader()`, and the file is then rewound using `fileobj.seek(0)` to read from the beginning.

4. It checks if the header is written correctly with `self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3\r\n")`.

5. It then writes a new row using `writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abc"})`.

6. The file is again rewound, the header is read and discarded using `fileobj.readline()`, and then the content is read to ensure it matches `"10,,abc"`.

The critical point to look for is how the `DictWriter` handles missing keys (in this case, `f2`). The expected behavior is that if a field is missing, the writer will insert an empty field for it.

Let's focus on the line:
```python
self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc")
```

The expected output indicates that `f1` has a value of `10`, `f2` is empty (since it's missing in the dictionary), and `f3` has a value of `abc`.

However, there is a slight mistake in the expected output of the test. The row that is written using the `csv.DictWriter` will end with a newline (`\r\n`), so the line:
```python
self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc")
```

should instead be:
```python
self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abc\r\n")
```

As a result, the test will fail as it's written. The rationale for the failure is that the test does not account for the newline at the end of the written row.
