Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import csv
    from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    ...
    def test_write_simple_dict(self):
        with TemporaryFile("w+", encoding="utf-8", newline='') as fileobj:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(fileobj, fieldnames = ["f1", "f2", "f3"])
            writer.writeheader()
            fileobj.seek(0)
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.readline(), "f1,f2,f3\r\n")
            writer.writerow({"f1": 10, "f3": "abcd"})
            fileobj.seek(0)
            fileobj.readline() # header
            self.assertEqual(fileobj.read(), "10,,abcd\r\n")
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The provided test is attempting to verify the correct functioning of writing dictionaries to a CSV file using Python's `csv.DictWriter` class. Here's a breakdown of what the test is doing:

1. A temporary file is created in "w+" mode (read/write mode), with UTF-8 encoding and newline handling specified.
2. A `csv.DictWriter` object is created for the temporary file with specified fieldnames ["f1", "f2", "f3"].
3. The header of the CSV is written using `writeheader()`.
4. The file position is reset to the beginning using `fileobj.seek(0)`.
5. The header of the CSV file is read and checked if it's "f1,f2,f3\r\n".
6. A dictionary with keys "f1" and "f3" (and their respective values) is written to the CSV file using `writer.writerow()`.
7. The file position is reset to the beginning again.
8. The header is read and discarded using `fileobj.readline()`.
9. The contents of the file are read and checked if they match "10,,abcd\r\n".

Considering the given operations, the test should pass because:

- The header is written correctly.
- When writing the dictionary with missing "f2" key, the `csv.DictWriter` correctly places an empty field for "f2".

However, a potential issue can arise if the system's default newline character is not `"\r\n"`. In that case, the assertion will fail. But since the newline is explicitly set to `''` (empty string) in the `TemporaryFile` creation, the writer will use `"\r\n"` as the newline, so this should not be an issue.

Given the provided test and the explanation, this test should pass.
