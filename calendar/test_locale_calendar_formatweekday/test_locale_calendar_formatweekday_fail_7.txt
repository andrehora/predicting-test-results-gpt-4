Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_locale_calendar_formatweekday(self):
        try:
            # formatweekday uses different day names based on the available width.
            cal = calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')
            # For really short widths, the abbreviated name is truncated.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(1, 1), "M")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")
            # For short widths, a centered, abbreviated name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 5), " Mon ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")
            # For long widths, the full day name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 9), "  Monday ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")
        except locale.Error:
            raise unittest.SkipTest('cannot set the en_US locale')
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

This test checks how the `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` formats the name of a weekday based on the available width.

Let's break down the logic of the test:

1. A `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` is created with the `en_US` locale.
2. It checks different widths for formatting weekday names:

   - For a width of 1 character, the day name is expected to be just the first character, e.g., `M` for Monday.
   - For a width of 2 characters, it expects the first two characters of the abbreviated day name, e.g., `Mo` for Monday.
   - For a width of 3 characters, it expects the abbreviated day name, e.g., `Mon` for Monday.
   - For a width of 5 characters, it expects the abbreviated day name centered, e.g., ` Mon `.
   - For a width of 8 characters, it expects the abbreviated day name centered with additional spaces, e.g., `  Mon   `.
   - For a width of 9 or more characters, it expects the full day name centered, e.g., `  Monday ` for a width of 9, and `  Monday  ` for a width of 10.

If the `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` behaves as described in the comments, the test should pass.

However, potential sources of failure could be:

1. If the `en_US` locale cannot be set, then `locale.Error` is raised, and the test will be skipped. This doesn't mean the test fails; it just won't run.
2. If the actual outputs of `formatweekday` do not match the expected ones, then the test will fail.

From the provided test and my knowledge of the Python Standard Library (up to version 3.10), I do not see any immediate issues or misassumptions. Thus, assuming a proper implementation of the `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` method and that the `en_US` locale can be set, the test should pass.

However, in practice, to determine if this test will pass or fail, one would need to run it in the appropriate environment and ensure the `en_US` locale is available and properly configured. If there have been changes or issues in the `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` method post-version 3.10, those could also affect the outcome.
