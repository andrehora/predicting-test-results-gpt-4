Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_locale_calendar_formatweekday(self):
        try:
            # formatweekday uses different day names based on the available width.
            cal = calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')
            # For really short widths, the abbreviated name is truncated.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 1), "M")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")
            # For short widths, a centered, abbreviated name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 5), " Mon ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")
            # For long widths, the full day name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(1, 9), "  Monday ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")
        except locale.Error:
            raise unittest.SkipTest('cannot set the en_US locale')
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

Let's break down the given test and determine whether it will pass or fail. 

This test is checking the functionality of the `formatweekday` method of the `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` class when the locale is set to 'en_US'.

1. **Initialization**
   
   `cal = calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')` 
   
   This initializes a calendar with the locale set to 'en_US'. If this locale isn't available on the machine running the test, it will raise a `locale.Error`, and the test will be skipped.

2. **Width = 1**

   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 1), "M")`
   
   For a width of 1, the first day of the week (Monday) is abbreviated to just "M". This seems correct.

3. **Width = 2**

   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")`
   
   For a width of 2, the abbreviation is "Mo". This seems correct as well.

4. **Width = 3**

   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")`
   
   For a width of 3, the abbreviation is "Mon". This is correct.

5. **Width = 5**

   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 5), " Mon ")`
   
   For a width of 5, the abbreviation is centered, leading to " Mon ". This seems correct.

6. **Width = 8**

   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")`
   
   For a width of 8, the abbreviation "Mon" is centered, leading to two spaces on the left and three spaces on the right. This seems correct.

7. **Width = 9 for Tuesday**

   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(1, 9), "  Monday ")`

   This is checking for the name of the second day (Tuesday), but it's expecting the full name for Monday. This assertion is incorrect, and the test will fail here. The expected value should be " Tuesday ", not " Monday ".

8. **Width = 10**

   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")`

   For a width of 10, the full name "Monday" is centered, leading to two spaces on both the left and the right. This is correct.

**Conclusion**: The test will fail at the 7th assertion (`self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(1, 9), "  Monday ")`). The test is mistakenly checking for the full name of the second day (Tuesday) but expects the name for the first day (Monday). The correct expected value for this assertion should be " Tuesday ".
