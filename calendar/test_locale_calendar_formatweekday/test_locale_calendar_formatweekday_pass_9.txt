Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_locale_calendar_formatweekday(self):
        try:
            # formatweekday uses different day names based on the available width.
            cal = calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')
            
            # For really short widths, the abbreviated name is truncated.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 1), "M")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 5), " Mon ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")
            
            # For long widths, the full day name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 9), "  Monday ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")
        except locale.Error:
            raise unittest.SkipTest('cannot set the en_US locale')
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

This test is designed to check the behavior of the `formatweekday` method from the `LocaleTextCalendar` class in the `calendar` module, specifically for the locale 'en_US'.

The test is trying to verify that the day name is formatted correctly based on the provided width. The day in question is Monday, which is represented by the index `0`.

Let's break down the test:

1. For widths 1, 2, and 3, the expected values are "M", "Mo", and "Mon" respectively. This is consistent with the expectation that with small widths, the day name will be truncated.

2. For widths of 5 and 8, the test expects there to be spaces padding the day name, " Mon " and "  Mon   " respectively.

3. For longer widths of 9 and 10, the full day name "Monday" is expected with spaces padding it.

Now, let's check for potential issues:

- One potential problem is the assumption about space padding. The exact formatting with regard to padding might differ between versions or platforms, leading to a failure.

- Another potential issue is the missing import of the `locale` module and the `unittest` module. For the given code snippet to run properly, these modules should be imported. 

To ascertain whether this test will pass or fail, you'd ideally want to run it in a Python 3.10 environment. Based on the code alone, it seems logical and should pass, but without executing it in the exact environment, it's hard to guarantee.

However, if the test fails, one of the most likely reasons would be incorrect assumptions about padding or the width-based formatting provided by `formatweekday`.

To confirm whether the test passes or not, you should run the test on a Python 3.10 environment. If there's a failure, the assertion error message will indicate which line failed and provide the actual output, which would help pinpoint the exact issue.
