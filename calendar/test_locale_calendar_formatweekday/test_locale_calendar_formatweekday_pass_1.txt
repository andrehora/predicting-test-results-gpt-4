Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_locale_calendar_formatweekday(self):
        try:
            # formatweekday uses different day names based on the available width.
            cal = calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')
            # For really short widths, the abbreviated name is truncated.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(1, 1), "T")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")
            # For short widths, a centered, abbreviated name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 5), " Mon ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")
            # For long widths, the full day name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 9), "  Monday ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")
        except locale.Error:
            raise unittest.SkipTest('cannot set the en_US locale')
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test in question is using the `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` class to test day formatting for different widths with the 'en_US' locale.

Let's go through the test step by step:

1. It creates a `LocaleTextCalendar` with the 'en_US' locale.
2. The test checks the output of the `formatweekday` method for various widths and day indexes.

Let's check the assertions one by one:

1. For width = 1 and weekday = 1 (Tuesday): 
   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(1, 1), "T")` 
   The expectation is that with just 1 character width, the day is represented as "T" which seems valid since Tuesday is abbreviated as 'Tue', and taking just the first letter gives "T".

2. For width = 2 and weekday = 0 (Monday): 
   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")`
   Monday's abbreviated name is 'Mon', so taking the first two characters gives "Mo".

3. For width = 3 and weekday = 0 (Monday):
   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")`
   This is just the abbreviated name for Monday.

4. For width = 5 and weekday = 0 (Monday):
   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 5), " Mon ")`
   The day's abbreviated name is centered within 5 characters.

5. For width = 8 and weekday = 0 (Monday):
   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")`
   The day's abbreviated name is centered within 8 characters. This should be "   Mon  " with three spaces before and two spaces after "Mon" to center it in a width of 8 characters. This assertion is incorrect.

6. For width = 9 and weekday = 0 (Monday):
   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 9), "  Monday ")`
   The day's full name is centered within 9 characters.

7. For width = 10 and weekday = 0 (Monday):
   `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")`
   The day's full name is centered within 10 characters.

Given the above analysis, the test will fail at the assertion:
`self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")`

The expected value should be "   Mon  " for that assertion to pass.
