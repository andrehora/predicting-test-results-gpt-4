Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_locale_calendar_formatweekday(self):
        try:
            # formatweekday uses different day names based on the available width.
            cal = calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')
            # For really short widths, the abbreviated name is truncated.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 1), "M ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")
            # For short widths, a centered, abbreviated name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 5), " Mon ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")
            # For long widths, the full day name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 9), "  Monday ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")
        except locale.Error:
            raise unittest.SkipTest('cannot set the en_US locale')
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

This test focuses on the behavior of the `formatweekday` method of the `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` class in the Python Standard Library for version 3.10. The goal is to verify how the weekday name is formatted depending on the width provided.

To determine whether this test will pass or fail, we need to break down the assertions:

1. For a width of 1, it's expected to get "M ". This means only the first character with a space padding.
2. For a width of 2, "Mo" is expected, which is the first two characters of "Monday".
3. For a width of 3, the entire abbreviation "Mon" is expected.
4. For a width of 5, " Mon " is expected, which is the abbreviation centered with space padding.
5. For a width of 8, "  Mon   " is expected, where the abbreviation "Mon" is centered with space padding.
6. For a width of 9, "  Monday " is expected, which means the full name "Monday" with space padding.
7. For a width of 10, "  Monday  " is expected, which is the full name "Monday" centered with space padding.

If the behavior of `formatweekday` method adheres to these specifications, then the test will pass. 

However, the method might not necessarily format the weekday exactly as mentioned above. For instance, it might not add the expected number of space paddings for certain widths or it might not truncate or format the names as expected.

Another potential point of failure is the locale setting. If the machine or environment where the test is being run doesn't support the 'en_US' locale, the test would raise a `locale.Error` and be skipped. But this doesn't indicate a failure in the assertions, just a skip due to environmental constraints.

From the code provided, without executing it or seeing the behavior of the Python 3.10 Standard Library, we can't definitively say whether it will pass or fail. If you have access to a Python 3.10 environment, executing the test will give you the answer. If it fails, the assertion error messages will provide insight into the rationale for the failure.
