Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_locale_calendar_formatweekday(self):
        try:
            # formatweekday uses different day names based on the available width.
            cal = calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')
            # For really short widths, the abbreviated name is truncated.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 1), "M")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")
            # For short widths, a centered, abbreviated name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(1, 5), " Tue ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")
            # For long widths, the full day name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 9), "  Monday ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")
        except locale.Error:
            raise unittest.SkipTest('cannot set the en_US locale')
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

Let's break down the test to understand its functionality and then determine whether it would pass or fail.

1. The test is for the `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` class which is a subclass of `calendar.TextCalendar`. This subclass allows formatting of the calendar using a specified locale.
   
2. The locale chosen in the test is `'en_US'` which is the English locale for the United States. 

3. The method being tested is `formatweekday`, which returns a localized weekday name formatted within a specified width. 

Let's evaluate each assertion:

1. `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 1), "M")`
   
   This line is checking that the weekday name for Monday (0 is the index for Monday) with a width of 1 character is `"M"`. This seems correct.

2. `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")`
   
   With a width of 2 characters, Monday should be abbreviated to "Mo".

3. `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")`
   
   With a width of 3 characters, Monday should be abbreviated to "Mon".

4. `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(1, 5), " Tue ")`
   
   Here, we're looking at Tuesday (index 1) with a width of 5 characters. The assertion expects it to be centered with spaces around it. This seems correct.

5. `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")`
   
   For Monday with a width of 8 characters, it's centered with spaces around it. This seems correct.

6. `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 9), "  Monday ")`
   
   With a width of 9 characters, the full name "Monday" should be used and it should be centered with spaces. This seems correct.

7. `self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")`
   
   For a width of 10 characters, the full name "Monday" should be used and it should be centered with spaces on both sides. This seems correct.

Finally, if there's any error due to the locale, the test will be skipped with the message `'cannot set the en_US locale'`.

Considering the descriptions provided, and without any other context about potential implementation changes in Python 3.10, it seems like the test should pass. However, for absolute certainty, you'd want to run the test on a Python 3.10 environment with the `en_US` locale available.
