Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_locale_calendar_formatweekday(self):
        try:
            # formatweekday uses different day names based on the available width.
            cal = calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')
            # For really short widths, the abbreviated name is truncated.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 1), "M")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")
            # For short widths, a centered, abbreviated name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 5), " Mon ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")
            # For long widths, the full day name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 9), "  Monday ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 11), "  Monday  ")
        except locale.Error:
            raise unittest.SkipTest('cannot set the en_US locale')
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The provided code tests the behavior of the `formatweekday` method of the `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` class for the `'en_US'` locale. Before I determine if it'll pass or fail, let's break down the assertions:

1. The method `formatweekday` should format the name of the weekday based on the provided width.
2. For very short widths, the name should be truncated. E.g., for width 1 and 2, we expect "M" and "Mo" respectively for Monday.
3. For short widths, a centered abbreviated name is expected. E.g., for width 3, 5, and 8, we expect "Mon", " Mon ", and "  Mon   " respectively.
4. For longer widths, the full day name is used. E.g., for width 9 and 11, we expect "  Monday " and "  Monday  " respectively.

Based on the documentation and typical behavior of the `calendar` module in Python 3.10 (up to my last training data in January 2022), the assertions seem logically consistent with what one would expect. 

However, there are a couple of potential points of failure:

1. **Locale Settings**: If the locale 'en_US' cannot be set on the environment where the test runs, the test will be skipped due to the `except locale.Error` clause. This doesn't mean the test fails, but it won't run. This is common on systems where the specified locale isn't available.

2. **String Spacing**: Any mistake in the expected number of spaces before or after the weekday names could cause a mismatch and thus fail the test. For example, for a width of 8, the code expects "  Mon   ", which is centered with two spaces before and three spaces after. If this behavior were to be different in the actual implementation, the test would fail.

3. **Unexpected Changes in Python Standard Library**: If there were any changes or updates in the Python 3.10 standard library after my last update in January 2022, I might not be aware of them. So, if there are any changes in the behavior of `formatweekday` after this point, the test might fail.

Given the information available up to January 2022, the test looks logically sound and should pass in the ideal conditions (assuming the 'en_US' locale is available). However, always remember to run tests in the real-world environment to catch unexpected issues or changes.
