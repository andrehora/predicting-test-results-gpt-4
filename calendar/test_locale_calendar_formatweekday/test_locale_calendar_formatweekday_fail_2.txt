Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_locale_calendar_formatweekday(self):
        try:
            # formatweekday uses different day names based on the available width.
            cal = calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')
            # For really short widths, the abbreviated name is truncated.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 1), "M")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "M")
            # For short widths, a centered, abbreviated name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 5), " Mon ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")
            # For long widths, the full day name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 9), "  Monday ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")
        except locale.Error:
            raise unittest.SkipTest('cannot set the en_US locale')
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test code provided is checking how the `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` class from the Python Standard Library formats weekday names based on different widths. The chosen locale is `en_US`. 

Given the code provided, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine if the test will pass:

1. It initializes a `LocaleTextCalendar` with the `en_US` locale. 

2. It then checks the output of the `formatweekday` method with varying widths and expects different results.

3. The method `formatweekday` takes two arguments: the weekday (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, and so on) and the width.

4. The test is using Monday (0) as the weekday for all checks.

Let's check the expected results:

- For width `1` and `2`, it expects the result to be `M`.
- For width `3`, it expects the result to be `Mon`.
- For width `5`, it expects the result to be ` Mon `.
- For width `8`, it expects the result to be `  Mon   `.
- For width `9` and `10`, it expects the result to be `  Monday ` and `  Monday  ` respectively.

Given the logic of the method described in the comments and the assertions provided, it seems like:

1. For really short widths (1 or 2), the abbreviated name is truncated.
2. For short widths (like 3, 5, 8), an abbreviated name is used and it's centered based on the width provided.
3. For longer widths (like 9 and above), the full day name is used and it's also centered.

Based on the provided code and my knowledge of Python's `calendar` module up to version 3.10, the test logic seems correct. 

However, the test could potentially fail if:
1. There's an underlying change in the `calendar` module that hasn't been documented or isn't known to us. 
2. The locale `en_US` isn't available on the machine the test is being run on. In such a case, it'll raise a `locale.Error` and the test will be skipped.

Barring these potential issues, the test should pass.
