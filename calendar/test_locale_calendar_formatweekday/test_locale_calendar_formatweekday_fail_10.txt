Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_locale_calendar_formatweekday(self):
        try:
            # formatweekday uses different day names based on the available width.
            cal = calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')
            # For really short widths, the abbreviated name is truncated.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 1), "M")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")
            # For short widths, a centered, abbreviated name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 5), " Mon ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")
            # For long widths, the full day name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 9), "  Monday ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(1, 10), "  Monday  ")
        except locale.Error:
            raise unittest.SkipTest('cannot set the en_US locale')
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The code provided is a unit test that checks how `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar()` behaves when formatting weekdays given a certain width. The behavior depends on the width provided. For example, with a width of 1, Monday would be represented as "M", with a width of 3 as "Mon", and so on.

There are a couple of observations about the test:

1. The test uses `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')` to create a `LocaleTextCalendar` with the 'en_US' locale. The availability of this locale is system-dependent, which is why the test code is wrapped in a `try...except` block to catch `locale.Error`. If the 'en_US' locale cannot be set, the test will be skipped. This is not a test failure, but rather a skip, which means the test won't be executed.

2. It seems there's an inconsistency in the test. The last line:
```python
self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(1, 10), "  Monday  ")
```
is testing for the format of the second day of the week (index `1`, typically representing Tuesday) but expects the result to be "  Monday  " (which is the full name for the first day of the week with spacing). This assertion will fail.

So, if the 'en_US' locale is available, the test will fail due to the inconsistency in the last assertion. If 'en_US' is not available, the test will be skipped. 

To fix this, you might want to change the last line to either:
- Test for Monday with width 10:
```python
self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")
```
- Or, test for Tuesday with width 10 (and adjust the expected string accordingly):
```python
self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(1, 10), "  Tuesday  ")
```

Given the code as is, the test will either fail (due to the inconsistency) or skip (if the 'en_US' locale isn't available).
