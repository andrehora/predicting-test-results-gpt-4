Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_locale_calendar_formatweekday(self):
        try:
            # formatweekday uses different day names based on the available width.
            cal = calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')
            # For really short widths, the abbreviated name is truncated.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 1), "M")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")
            # For short widths, a centered, abbreviated name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 5), " Mon ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")
            # For long widths, the full day name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(1, 9), " Tuesday ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")
        except locale.Error:
            raise unittest.SkipTest('cannot set the en_US locale')
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test is checking the behavior of the `formatweekday` function of the `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` class for different width values. The test assumes the behavior of this function for the `en_US` locale.

To determine if this test passes or fails, let's break down the assertions:

1. For a width of 1, it's expecting "M" for Monday. 
2. For a width of 2, it's expecting "Mo" for Monday.
3. For a width of 3, it's expecting "Mon" for Monday.
4. For a width of 5, it's expecting " Mon " for Monday (centered within the 5-character width).
5. For a width of 8, it's expecting "  Mon   " for Monday (centered within the 8-character width).
6. For a width of 9, it's expecting " Tuesday " for Tuesday (centered within the 9-character width).
7. For a width of 10, it's expecting "  Monday  " for Monday (centered within the 10-character width).

Given my knowledge of Python's `calendar` module as of version 3.10, the described behavior of `formatweekday` looks consistent with its documentation. However, there are two things to consider:

1. The behavior is subject to the specifics of the `en_US` locale. If there's any misconfiguration or if the locale is not available, the test would be skipped due to the `except locale.Error` block.
2. A potential point of failure might be related to the exact spacing around the day names. If the internal behavior of `formatweekday` adds or removes spaces in a different manner than expected, the test might fail.

However, based on the assumptions made in the test, it seems that the assertions are consistent with the expected behavior of `formatweekday` for the specified widths.

So, unless there are issues related to the specific environment or platform where the test is run, the test should pass. If it fails, it's likely due to incorrect spacing around the day names or the unavailability of the `en_US` locale.
