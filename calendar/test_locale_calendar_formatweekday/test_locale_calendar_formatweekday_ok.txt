Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_locale_calendar_formatweekday(self):
        try:
            # formatweekday uses different day names based on the available width.
            cal = calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(locale='en_US')
            # For really short widths, the abbreviated name is truncated.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 1), "M")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 2), "Mo")
            # For short widths, a centered, abbreviated name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 3), "Mon")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 5), " Mon ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 8), "  Mon   ")
            # For long widths, the full day name is used.
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 9), "  Monday ")
            self.assertEqual(cal.formatweekday(0, 10), "  Monday  ")
        except locale.Error:
            raise unittest.SkipTest('cannot set the en_US locale')
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

To determine whether the test will pass or fail, let's break down the code step by step.

1. The module `calendar` is imported.
2. Within the `test_locale_calendar_formatweekday` method, the code creates an instance of `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar` with the `locale` set to `'en_US'`.
3. Various assertions are made about how the method `formatweekday` behaves based on the second argument (width).

To evaluate this code, we need to understand the behavior of the `formatweekday` method of `calendar.LocaleTextCalendar`. Here's the expected behavior according to the test comments:

- For widths of 1 and 2, the day name is truncated.
- For widths of 3, 5, and 8, the day name is abbreviated and centered.
- For widths of 9 and 10, the full day name is used and centered.

From the comments, we gather the following:
- `0` stands for Monday.
- The first argument to `formatweekday` represents the day of the week, with `0` being Monday.

Now, let's evaluate the test assertions for the day Monday:

1. For width 1, "M"
2. For width 2, "Mo"
3. For width 3, "Mon"
4. For width 5, " Mon "
5. For width 8, "  Mon   "
6. For width 9, "  Monday "
7. For width 10, "  Monday  "

Assuming the `formatweekday` function has been correctly implemented to produce these outputs (and the comments suggest this is the expected behavior), all assertions should hold true.

However, there's one catch: the test is wrapped in a `try` block that catches `locale.Error` and raises a test skip if the `'en_US'` locale cannot be set. This means that if there is an issue with setting the locale, the test will not fail but will be skipped.

In conclusion:
- If the `formatweekday` function is correctly implemented, the assertions will pass.
- If there's a problem setting the `'en_US'` locale, the test won't fail but will be skipped.
- If there's any discrepancy in the expected output of `formatweekday` and its actual output (for the given inputs), the test will fail.

Without additional context or evidence of a misimplementation, we can assume the test will pass. If it were to fail, it would be due to the actual output of `formatweekday` not matching the expected output in the assertions.
