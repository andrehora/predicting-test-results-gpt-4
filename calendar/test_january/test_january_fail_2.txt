Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_january(self):
        # Tests valid lower boundary case.
        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,1), (3,30))
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

This test will fail. 

Here's why:

The `calendar.monthrange(year, month)` function returns a tuple containing the day of the week (0 for Monday, 6 for Sunday) of the first day of the month and the number of days in the month.

Let's break down the assertion:
```python
self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,1), (3,30))
```

This is checking if January (month=1) of the year 2004 starts on a Thursday (day=3) and has 30 days.

However, there are a couple of mistakes here:

1. January always has 31 days, not 30.
2. The starting day of the week for January 2004 can be calculated. 

To verify the starting day for January 2004, we can do the following:
```python
import calendar
print(calendar.monthrange(2004,1))
```

When you run the above code, you'll find that January 2004 started on a Thursday (which is correct in the test), but it has 31 days.

So, the corrected tuple should be `(3,31)`. 

Thus, the test will fail because it's expecting `(3,30)` but the actual value returned by `calendar.monthrange(2004,1)` is `(3,31)`.
