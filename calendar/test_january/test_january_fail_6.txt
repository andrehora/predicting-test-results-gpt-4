Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_january(self):
        # Tests valid lower boundary case.
        with self.assertRaises(calendar.IllegalMonthError):
            self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,1), (3,31))
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's break down the test `test_january`:

1. The function `calendar.monthrange(year, month)` returns two integers. The first one is the code of the weekday for the first day of the month and the second one is the number of days in the month. The weekday is an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.

2. The test is attempting to check the return value of `calendar.monthrange(2004, 1)`, which is essentially checking the month range for January of the year 2004.

3. The expected result from `calendar.monthrange(2004, 1)` is `(3, 31)`, meaning that January 1, 2004, was a Thursday (3) and January had 31 days.

4. However, the test is written in such a way that it's asserting that calling `calendar.monthrange(2004, 1)` would raise an `calendar.IllegalMonthError`. 

Given the above:

- January (i.e., `1`) is a valid month, so `calendar.IllegalMonthError` should not be raised by the call `calendar.monthrange(2004, 1)`.

- This means the `with self.assertRaises(calendar.IllegalMonthError):` block will fail because the expected exception won't be raised.

So, the test will **fail**. 

Rationale:

1. `calendar.monthrange(2004, 1)` is a valid call and won't raise `calendar.IllegalMonthError`.
2. The `assertRaises
