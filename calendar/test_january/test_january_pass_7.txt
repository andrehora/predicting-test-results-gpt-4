    import calendar
    ...
    def test_january(self):
        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,1), (3,31))

===

Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_january(self):
        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,1), (3,31))
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

The function `calendar.monthrange(year, month)` returns two values: 
1. The code of the weekday of the first day of the month.
2. The number of days in the month.

The weekdays are indexed as 0 (Monday) through 6 (Sunday).

Given the input `(2004, 1)`, the function will return:
1. The weekday code for January 1, 2004.
2. The number of days in January 2004.

Now, let's break down the values:

1. January 1, 2004 was a Thursday, which corresponds to a code of 3.
2. January always has 31 days.

Thus, the function `calendar.monthrange(2004, 1)` should return `(3, 31)`.

Given this, the test:
```
self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,1), (3,31))
```
will pass.
