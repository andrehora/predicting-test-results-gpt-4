Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_january(self):
        # Tests invalid lower boundary case.
        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,1), (3,31))
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The function `calendar.monthrange(year, month)` returns a tuple containing two elements:

1. An integer representing the day of the week of the first day of the specified month. (Monday is 0, Sunday is 6).
2. The number of days in the month.

Let's break down the test:

```
self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,1), (3,31))
```

The test checks the result of `calendar.monthrange(2004, 1)` against the expected tuple `(3,31)`.

1. The year 2004 is a leap year, which means February has 29 days. However, this test is for January, so that doesn't directly impact the result.
2. January always has 31 days.

Now, let's check the day of the week for January 1, 2004. January 1, 2004, was a Thursday. In the `calendar` module, Monday is represented by 0 and Sunday by 6, so Thursday is represented by 3.

Thus, the expected result for `calendar.monthrange(2004,1)` is indeed `(3,31)`.

The test should pass.
