Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_january(self):
        # Tests valid lower boundary case.
        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,1), (4,31))
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

The test is checking the output of the `calendar.monthrange(year, month)` function for January 2004. The `monthrange` function returns a tuple with the following format:

`(weekday_of_first_day_of_month, number_of_days_in_month)`

The weekdays are numbered as:
0 = Monday
1 = Tuesday
...
6 = Sunday

Let's break down the test:

`calendar.monthrange(2004, 1)`: 
This asks for the range of January 2004.

The test checks that this returns `(4,31)`.

The number `31` indicates January has 31 days, which is correct.

The number `4` indicates that January 1, 2004, was a Thursday.

Let's verify this. 

January 1, 2004, was indeed a Thursday. 

Thus, the test will pass.
