Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_january(self):
        # Tests valid lower boundary case.
        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,1), (3,31))
        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,2), (6,29))
        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2010,2), (0,28))
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

Let's analyze the `calendar.monthrange(year, month)` function. This function returns a tuple containing the first weekday of the month and the number of days in the month. Weekdays are numbered 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday). 

Given this understanding, let's evaluate each test case:

1. `calendar.monthrange(2004,1)`: 
   - This will return the first weekday of January 2004 and the number of days in January 2004.
   - January always has 31 days.
   - The test is asserting that the tuple returned should be `(3,31)`, meaning that January 1st, 2004 was a Thursday (since 3 represents Thursday). 

2. `calendar.monthrange(2004,2)`: 
   - This will return the first weekday of February 2004 and the number of days in February 2004.
   - 2004 was a leap year, so February had 29 days.
   - The test is asserting that the tuple returned should be `(6,29)`, meaning that February 1st, 2004 was a Sunday (since 6 represents Sunday).

3. `calendar.monthrange(2010,2)`:
   - This will return the first weekday of February 2010 and the number of days in February 2010.
   - 2010 was not a leap year, so February had 28 days.
   - The test is asserting that the tuple returned should be `(0,28)`, meaning that February 1st, 2010 was a Monday (since 0 represents Monday).

Let's verify if these assertions are correct:

1. January 1st, 2004 was indeed a Thursday.
2. February 1st, 2004 was indeed a Sunday.
3. February 1st, 2010 was indeed a Monday.

Given the above verification, the test will **pass**.
