Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_january(self):
        # Tests valid lower boundary case.
        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,13), (3,31))
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test will fail. Let's break down why:

The `calendar.monthrange(year, month)` function returns a tuple containing two integers. The first one is the weekday of the first day of the specified month and the second one is the number of days in that month.

In the test, the function is being called with parameters `2004` (year) and `13` (month). However, there are only 12 months in a year, so `13` is an invalid month value.

The expected value in the test is `(3,31)`, but when given an invalid month value, the `calendar.monthrange` function will raise a `ValueError`.

So, the test will fail because instead of returning the expected tuple, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the invalid month value.
