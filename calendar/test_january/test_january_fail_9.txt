Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_january(self):
        # Tests valid lower boundary case.
        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2010,2), (0,29))
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

The test provided is checking the `monthrange` method of the `calendar` module, which returns two integers. The first integer represents the day of the week for the first day of the month (0 for Monday, 6 for Sunday) and the second integer represents the last day of the month (i.e., the number of days in the month).

In the test:

```
self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2010,2), (0,29))
```

We're checking the monthrange for February 2010.

However, 2010 was not a leap year. In the Gregorian calendar, a year is a leap year if:
1. It is divisible by 4, but
2. Not divisible by 100, unless
3. It is divisible by 400.

2010 is not divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year. Thus, February 2010 only has 28 days.

So the expected output for the `calendar.monthrange(2010,2)` is `(0,28)`, not `(0,29)`.

The test will fail. The correct assertion should be:

```
self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2010,2), (0,28))
```
