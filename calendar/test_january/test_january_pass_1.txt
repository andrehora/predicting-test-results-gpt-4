Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_january(self):
        # Tests valid lower boundary case.
        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,2), (6,29))
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

The test is checking the `monthrange` method from the `calendar` module. The `monthrange` function takes two arguments: a year and a month. It returns two values:

1. The code of the weekday for the first day of that month (0 for Monday, 6 for Sunday).
2. The number of days in that month.

Let's break down the test:

```
self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,2), (6,29))
```

This test is checking the month of February in the year 2004. The test expects:

1. The month to start on a Sunday (6).
2. The month to have 29 days.

Let's evaluate this:

2004 is a leap year because:
1. It is divisible by 4, and
2. It is not divisible by 100, or if it is, it should also be divisible by 400. (2004 is not divisible by 100, so this point doesn't apply.)

Thus, February 2004 should have 29 days. This checks out with the second part of the tuple.

Next, February 1, 2004, was a Sunday. So the first part of the tuple (6) is also correct.

Based on this analysis, the test should pass.
