    import calendar

        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,1), (3,31))

Consider the following test of the Python Standard Library, version 3.10: 

```
    import calendar
    ...
    def test_january(self):
        # Tests valid lower boundary case.
        self.assertEqual(calendar.monthrange(2004,1), (3,31))
```

Your job is to figure out whether this test will pass or fail.
If it fails, provide the rationale.

===

The function `calendar.monthrange(year, month)` returns two integers. The first one is the code of the weekday for the first day of the month and the second one is the number of days in the month. The weekdays are coded as follows:

0 = Monday
1 = Tuesday
...
6 = Sunday

The test provided is checking the result of `calendar.monthrange(2004,1)`, which corresponds to January 2004.

For the test to pass, two conditions must be met:

1. January 1, 2004, should be a Thursday (since the weekday code 3 represents Thursday).
2. January 2004 should have 31 days.

Let's check these:

1. January 1, 2004, was indeed a Thursday, so the first value (3) in the tuple is correct.
2. January always has 31 days.

Therefore, the expected return value of `calendar.monthrange(2004,1)` is indeed `(3,31)`.

The test will pass.
